Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO

In the 1960s, the US began a love affair with chicken, and poultry workers paid the cost. Over the past few decades, poultry processing line speeds have increased to meet demand. But that’s happened in tandem with the decline of unions and deregulation of the industry. The result is a high rate of workplace injuries and repetitive motion disorders, with gaps in workplace safety oversight. 

For this video, we contacted Tyson Foods Inc. and the National Chicken Council for comment. The NCC, the poultry industry lobby that has repeatedly requested increases in line speeds, wrote that faster line speeds do not affect the pace of work because plants will add additional staff and lines to accommodate speed increases. Through our reporting, we weren’t able to substantiate this claim, and the NCC did not respond when we asked for an example or for any evidence that this is the industry standard. 

The NCC also mentioned that other countries run poultry line speeds as fast as, if not faster than, the US. It’s difficult to do an apples-to-apples comparison with other countries. Claire Kelloway, reporter and researcher for OpenMarkets, noted that in Europe, for example, factories are typically smaller than US plants, and have higher rates of unionization and more industry safety regulation. The regulating agencies enforce longer breaks and switching up job roles to avoid repetition. Even so, working conditions in poultry plants are still criticized there. 

While the NCC cited a decline in workplace injuries, advocates and experts say that this data is unreliable. It relies on workers reporting injuries to the government agency that regulates workplace safety, OSHA. There are a number of reasons a poultry worker might not report an injury or illness, including language barriers or fears over their citizenship status. Worker and advocate-led surveys show high levels of injury, here are examples:

Tyson disputes, without evidence, the petition that Magaly Licolli presented on behalf of the workers at the Berry Street poultry plant in Springdale, Arkansas. The company said it was misrepresented to those who signed it and that there were duplicate signatures. Tyson also noted that it offered raises to poultry workers in 2021 amid a labor shortage. 

We also contacted OSHA for comment. They noted that they issue citations or fines to any workplace found by federal inspectors to have violated their safety standards, but confirmed that it is under the jurisdiction of the USDA to determine line speeds. They also said that they do not track data on the use of the chemicals we mention in the video: chlorine, ammonia, and peracetic acid. 

While reporting this episode I read Christopher Leonard’s The Meat Racket, a deep-dive report into the history of Tyson and the poultry industry:

igOZPfNvzVc,hd,"The Al Jazeera Media Network turns 25 years old this month and looks back at a history marked by obstacles, threats and attacks; none of which deterred it from pursuing its journalism with fairness, accuracy and a focus on telling the world's unheard stories. 

Al Jazeera launched as an Arabic-language satellite news channel in 1996, broadcasting from Qatar's capital Doha, with a mission to challenge the manner in which the dominant international news channels at the time framed global events from a Western perspective.

The first independent news channel in the Arab world, it featured an array of voices, including perspectives from all sides - a policy that drew ire from many. Since then, it has grown into a network of multiple channels and digital platforms, including Al Jazeera English and AJ+.

Al Jazeera has been the news source for several of the biggest stories over the past quarter of a century - the Gulf War, the Arab Spring, multiple conflicts in Gaza, and historic events in the Middle East, Africa and elsewhere. Then US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in 2011 said the state department was getting most of its information on the Arab Spring from Al Jazeera.

""Viewership of Al Jazeera is going up in the United States because it's real news,"" she said.

In this show, we gather a panel of voices from Al Jazeera Arabic, Al Jazeera English and AJ+ to discuss the highs and lows of the past 25 years and to take questions, and hear thoughts from the network's audience.

MdCy1Lr9Jqw,hd,"As Tigrayan rebels advanced towards the capital Addis Ababa this week, Ethiopia declared a state of emergency with Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed calling on citizens to take up arms and defend the city. 

The conflict - which started a year ago in the northern region of Tigray - has spread to the neighbouring states of Afar and Amhara. Tigrayan fighters are now moving south towards the capital, so far claiming control over two cities north of Addis Ababa.
 
Thousands of people have been killed in the conflict, millions have been displaced and hundreds of thousands are enduring famine conditions, according to the UN.

The war began in November 2020 when Ethiopia's central government launched an offensive against the Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF), the then ruling party of the Tigray region, in response to what the government said was a TPLF attack an army base. 

All sides in the conflict have committed atrocities that may amount to war crimes and crimes against humanity, according to a report by the UN and Ethiopian government-run Ethiopian Human Rights Commission (EHRC). UN human rights chief Michelle Bachelet said, though, that ""the big numbers of violations” were linked to the Ethiopian military and to the Eritrean military, which entered the conflict on the side of the government.

In this episode of The Stream, we’ll discuss the ongoing conflict and its impact on Ethiopians.

ZTFLsFu7g1c,hd,"The Big Picture: Britain’s True Colours? addresses a singular question: When it came to the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom, why did Black and brown people die in disproportionately greater numbers than white people?

The answer, as is revealed, can be traced to two prevailing aspects of the modern UK: racism and neoliberalism. This film examines the roots of these converging forces.

By mixing documentary storytelling with in-depth analysis, three British journalists, writer/director Sanjiev Johal, reporter Flo Phillips, and assistant producer Hanna Adan, allow history to cast new light on the effect of COVID. They show how structural racism, racialised capitalism and neoliberal orthodoxy were not just central to the pandemic experience, but to the shaping of the UK itself.

Charting post-war British history through to the aftermath of the pandemic, this film explains why rampant inequality and racial injustice remains embedded in the UK today.

""For a few brief hours on Wednesday, it seemed like Democrats would propose a tax on billionaires.

Democrats are still hammering out the details of what will be in a final social-spending package, but the tax-focused on billionaires looks like it's getting chopped. The architect of the tax, Sen. Ron Wyden, the chair of the Senate finance committee, told Insider's Joseph Zeballos-Roig that ""this is not done"" as he fights to keep it alive.

But at least one person who would be affected by the proposal would be thrilled to see it on the cutting-room floor.""

""White House adviser Cedric Richmond appeared on Fox News over the weekend where he blasted correspondent Peter Doocy for asking President Joe Biden ""absurd"" questions about migrant families.

During a Sunday interview on Fox News, host Bill Hemmer presented a video of Doocy grilling the president about payouts to migrant families who lost a child due to the policies of former President Donald Trump's administration. At the time, Doocy suggested that some migrant families may plot to have a child taken away from them in hopes of getting money from the U.S. government.

Doocy said that the payments might ""incentivize"" families to want to lose children in exchange for money.""

""During a House Judiciary Committee hearing on Texas’s controversial abortion law on Thursday, Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-WA) absolutely laid into Rep. Chip Roy (R-TX) for his “paternalistic” attitude toward women.

At issue in the hearing was S.B. 8 in Texas, which is a highly unusual anti-abortion law that doesn’t rely on state enforcement, but rather allows private citizens to sue people they think have assisted a woman in getting an abortion after six weeks of pregnancy. The law is also known as the Texas Heartbeat Act, so named because six weeks is around the time fetal cardiac activity can be detected. As many critics of the law have pointed out, many if not most women do not even know they are pregnant at six weeks.""

Third, the internet is full of callous, misanthropic East Coasters who often look down disdainfully on middle America, and highlighting their mockery is probably not the best use of anyone’s time That said, (and we really do mean those three caveats), this lady in Texas is buying a lot of milk.""

Wang Yeping was joined by fellow astronaut Zhai Zhigang, another of the three-person team currently aboard China’s latest space station. The two successfully completed the 6.5-hour spacewalk in the early hours of Monday morning, according to the China Manned Space Agency.

A third astronaut, Ye Guangfu, assisted the duo from inside the station. State broadcaster CCTV shared footage of the astronauts carrying out their tasks and floating in space.

Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy and Republican Jack Ciattarelli were locked in what amounts to a tie in the New Jersey governor's race. 
The Associated Press had not declared a winner in the contest on Wednesday, which was too early to call. 
In Bergen County and across the state, election workers were busy counting mail-in and drop box ballots and adding them to the statewide vote tally. 
But Murphy had a lead of less than a percentage point in incomplete results as county elections officials continued to count ballots. 
The closeness of the race surprised experts, who watched public polls showing Murphy leading comfortably and looked to his party's registration advantage of more than a million voters. 
Murphy had no public schedule on Wednesday, and Ciattarelli has also not announced plans to appear publicly.

Pakistan's poor suffer amid spiraling inflation and growing fuel prices.
An independent economist says the government should interfere and give the poor a targeted subsidy on fuel.

STORY-LINE :
40-year-old Hameeda Khatoon, a widow living in Karachi, has four young children. 
The rising costs of necessities in Pakistan has made it increasingly hard for her to feed her family. 
""How can we survive in such circumstances? These conditions make us want to kill ourselves. It's better to die than live in such a manner,"" says Khatoon. 
The inflation rate in Pakistan has been close to 10% since 2019, according to World Bank. 
The government says the increase in prices in the country is the result of inflation across the world, but independent economists say that it is only one of the reasons behind the rising prices.
Pakistani economist Aqdas Afzal said there are local and international factors behind the steep increase in prices.
He said the government should interfere.
""The government needs to focus on the poor people. It needs to give them a targeted subsidy on fuel. It needs to raise the amount of money it's giving to the poor people in this country,"" Afzal said.
Much of the inflation in the country is driven by rising fuel prices. 
The price of petrol has risen to Rs137.79 ($0.79) a liter from Rs108.56 ($0.62) on June 1, an increase of 27%.

G1kcJ9FqDhg,sd,"(31 Oct 2021) Wole Soyinka, Nigeria's Nobel-winning author, sees his country's many problems — misgoverning politicians, systemic corruption, violent extremists, and kidnapping bandits — yet he does not despair.
At 87, he believes Nigeria's youth may have the energy and the know-how to get the troubled country back on track.
Soyinka credits young Nigerians between 15 and 35 — about a third of the population — for trying to fundamentally reform the country. 
He cites the #EndSARS protests a year ago against police brutality.
""The kind of energy and intelligence which created the #EndSARS movement is one, for instance, that can be used on a much broader scale to involve masses of people,"" he comments.
Soyinka won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1986, the first Black African to do so. 
Now he's published a new novel, his first in almost 50 years. 
In ""Chronicles from the Land of the Happiest People on Earth"" he has created a fictional Nigeria rife with crime, corruption and chaos,  governed by the oppressive People on the Move Party (POMP). 
The people it portrays are anything but happy, despite the annual, ironically-named, 'Festival of the People of Happiness'.
It's a parody of the real-life Nigeria of today under the leadership of President Muhammadu Buhari.
In 2015, Soyinka endorsed Buhari for president, and asked Nigerians to forgive his past as a former dictator in the 1980s.
Now Soyinka is critical of Buhari.
""Right from the middle of the first round of his government, it has failed on many levels and it is up to Nigerians to wake up and reverse the direction in which they are being taken,"" he says.
The author believes Buhari and his administration have been unable to tackle the extremist violence that's led to thousands of deaths and the mass kidnappings of schoolchildren.
""They refused to take action at the right time,"" he says. ""They compromised. They appeased. They excused. They even rhetoricized the danger, the reality. And in the process we lost our humanity completely."" 
Soyinka admits he is not as strong as he once was, but he's tired of reading his own obituary.
In Nigeria, fake news reports about Soyinka's death are rampant.
""I am getting bored with dying,"" he says. ""I am just bored each time I read my obituary. It's been going on for years.""

NP8JhahiFJM,sd,"(31 Oct 2021) The usually crowded center of Rome was deserted Sunday morning, with only security personnel, police and some disappointed tourists walking the streets.
The city center was cut off to car and pedestrian traffic to allow the leaders of the G20 countries to visit the Trevi Fountain.  
Disappointed tourists were told it was temporarily closed and were advised to move on.
A legend in Rome is that if one throws a coin in the Trevi Fountain, they will be sure to return. 
Thousands of coins are thrown in the fountain every day and the city regularly cleans them out and uses them for charitable causes. 
COVID-19 economic recovery and climate change have been the two main issues tackled by the leaders of the world's 20 biggest economies, who gathered in Rome this weekend and are heading to Glasgow, Scotland, for the U.N. climate conference - COP26.
The G20 countries represent 80% of the global economy.

Lebanon's airshow brings locals and soldiers together amid the country's unprecedented economic crisis.
Visitors got a closer look at air force equipment and mingled with pilots at the Rayak Airbase of the country's east.

STORY-LINE:  
Hundreds of Lebanese on Sunday attended an airshow by the Lebanese Army's air force in the eastern Bekaa Valley.
Light attack Tucano aircrafts, helicopters, a drone and weapons were on display at the event. 
The newly bought, U.S.-made MD530F helicopter was put into action for the first time.
Visitors walked in the airfield to have a closer look at air force equipment, take pictures and talk with the pilots.
They also watched a show of aerobatic maneuvers by the Tucano aircrafts.
""This is an entertaining and an educational day -- a patriotic day par excellence,"" said Col. Hassan Barakat, a pilot in the Lebanese Army.
""Amid the current situations, that all of us are going through, and that we (army) too are affected by, we are giving our people a glimmer of hope for a better future. Hope comes when they see us standing steadfast,"" he said.
Lebanon is going through the worst economic and financial crisis of its modern history.
The Lebanese have always considered their military as an anchor for stability, one of the only institutions standing above the country's divisions.
But the military is now threatened by Lebanon's devastating financial collapse.
The economic meltdown is putting unprecedented pressure on the U.S.-backed army's operational abilities, wiping out soldiers' salaries and wrecking morale.
""We came here to assure that we stand beside the Lebanese Army in war and in peace. There is no security without the Lebanese Army,"" one visitor said.

eWIY6bGixZE,sd,"(4 Nov 2021) A notorious gang leader in Haiti is calling for the United Nations and the United States to break ties with the country's government in order to help ""liberate Haiti"".
Jimmy ""Barbecue"" Chérizier, the leader of the G9 Family and Allies, a federation of nine violent gangs that control much of Port-au-Prince, issued the appeal duering a news conference on Wednesday in La Saline, one of the capital's poorest areas.
""We take this opportunity to invite the United Nations in general and the so-called friendly countries of Haiti, in particular the United States of America, to register in this page of history as loyal allies who want the well-being of the Haitian people by divorcing the status quo"", Chérizier said.
The G9 controls entire sections of the capital and their violent acts have many residents living in fear. 
They have been implicated in dozens of killings, including infants. 
The gang is responsible for burning neighbourhoods to the ground forcing thousands to flee, and for demanding extortion payments from businesses. 
Those who do not comply see their businesses looted or the owners killed.
Chérizier has repeatedly called for the resignation of Prime Minister Ariel Henry, blaming him for much of the unrest the country is experiencing.
The gang leader accused him of taking part in the assassination last July of President Jovenel Moise after mobile phone calls between Henry and Joseph Felix Badio, one of the prime suspects in the killing, became public.
The calls were made the night of the assassination. 
Henry denies remembering those calls and has said he spoke to many people that night, but does not remember speaking to Badio, whose whereabouts remain unknown.
While Chérizier fancies himself a liberator and a Robin Hood of sorts, the everyday reality for Haitians is much different. 
The G9 have sealed off access to country's main port in the capital leading to major fuel shortages that have affected all residents and caused outbursts of violence near gas stations and a general strike by workers unions.
Insecurity along with a lack of goods and general services under a government that seems overwhelmed and unable to bring stability to the Western Hemisphere's poorest nation, is what Haiti's population is experiencing on a daily basis.
Chérizier and his G9 show no signs of backing down.

مع تصاعد الخلاف الدبلوماسي مع السعودية وحلفائها، يسارع المواطنون اللبنانيون المقيمون في دول الخليج لمغاردة بيروت. 
القصة:
العشرات من المواطنين اللبنانيين الذين يزورون لبنان يبادرون  بالعودة ادراجهم إلى دول الخليج حيث يعيشون، في خضم نزاع دبلوماسي بين بلدهم الأم والسعودية.
المملكة أمرت سفير لبنان لدى الرياض بالمغادرة، وحظرت جميع الواردات القادمة من لبنان، في ضربة قوية للبلد الذي يعاني بالفعل من أسوأ أزمة اقتصادية يشهدها منذ عقود.
الكويت والبحرين والإمارات حذت جميعا حذو المملكة وأعلنت اتخاذ إجراءات ضد لبنان، ما زاد الضغط على البلد الذي يئن بالفعل تحت وطاة أزمته وفي أمس الحاجة للمساعدة الخارجية.
كثير من أبناء لبنان سارعوا للعودة للخليج مخافة تعليق الرحلات الجوية أو فرض مزيد من الإجراءات العقابية. 
التوتر اندلع بعد تصريح تلفزيوني أدلى به جورج قرداحي- أحد أشهر مقدمي البرامج التلفزيونية اللبنانيين والذي أصبح وزيرا للإعلام في الحكومة الحالية- حول الحرب في اليمن.
قرداحي كان ضيفا على أحد البرامج التلفزيونية في حلقة تم تصويرها في أغسطس/آب الماضي، لكنه بثت الأسبوع الماضي، وصف فيهالحرب في اليمن بأنها عدوان من السعودية والإمارات. 
قرداحي الذي يعارض نشوب حروب بين الدول العربية ، شدد على أن الحرب في اليمن ""عبثية"" ويجب أن تتوقف. 
دفع الغضب من تصريحات قرداحي دول الخليج العربية لاتخاذ خطوات تهدد بانقسام حكومة لبنان  الائتلافية الجديدة والمكلفة بوقف الانهيار الاقتصادي للبلاد.
الإجراءات العقابية التي أعلنتها السعودية-التي كانت يوما حليفا مهما ضخ ملايين الدولارات في لبنان- قد تتسبب في زيادة المعاناة الاقتصادية.
ذاك هو أحدث تصعيد في العداء الدائر منذ أمد بين السعودية وإيران على الساحة اللبنانية.
استمرت التوترات لسنوات حول الدور المهيمن لجماعة حزب الله المدعومة من إيران في لبنان. 
والآن يصر المسؤولون السعوديون على أنه من غير المجدي التعامل مع الحكومة في بيروت بعد كل هذا  الانجراف تجاه إيران.
قرداحي مقرب من حركة ""تيار المردة"" المسيحي، وحليف لجماعة حزب الله.

Lebanese citizens living in the Gulf are rushing to leave Beirut as a diplomatic spat with Saudi Arabia and its allies escalates.

STORY-LINE:
Scores of Lebanese citizens visiting Lebanon were returning to the Gulf nations where they live amid a diplomatic spat between the small Mediterranean country and Saudi Arabia.
The Kingdom ordered Lebanon's ambassador to Riyadh to leave and banned all imports from Lebanon in a major blow to the country that is already passing through its worst economic crisis in decades.
Kuwait, Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates followed suit with measures against Lebanon, increasing pressure on the crisis-hit country badly in need of foreign assistance.
Many Lebanese have rushed to go back to the Gulf fearing that flights might be stopped or further punitive measures are taken.
The tension started after a televised remark by a game show host turned cabinet minister in Lebanon about the war in Yemen.
During a TV program filmed in August and aired last week, George Kordahi described the war in Yemen as an aggression by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.
He added that the war in Yemen was ""absurd"" and must stop because he is opposed to wars between Arabs.
Anger over Kordahi's comments led to steps by Gulf Arab countries that threaten to split its new coalition government, tasked with halting the country's economic meltdown.
Punitive measures from Saudi Arabia, once an important ally that poured millions of dollars into Lebanon, could cause more economic pain.
It is the latest escalation in the rivalry that has long played out in Lebanon between Saudi Arabia and Iran.
Tensions have dragged on for years over the dominant role in Lebanon of the Iranian-backed militant Hezbollah group.
Now Saudi officials insist it is pointless to deal with the government in Beirut after so much drift toward Iran.
Kordahi is close to the Christian Marada movement, an ally of the militant Hezbollah group.

New England's largest city had previously only elected white men as mayor since its founding in 1630 by English puritans. 
Wu defeated fellow Boston City Councilor Annissa Essaibi George. 
The two Democrats faced off against each other after defeating other mayoral hopefuls in a September preliminary election. 
The election of Wu, whose parents immigrated from Taiwan, marks another break from tradition in Boston. 
Wu grew up in Chicago, moving to Boston to attend Harvard University and Harvard Law School. 
Boston typically elects mayors with lifelong Boston roots. 
Wu takes office on Nov. 16.

Robot food delivery is no longer the stuff of science fiction. 
Hundreds of little robots are now navigating college campuses and city sidewalks in the U.S., the U.K. and elsewhere.

STORY-LINE:
Robot food delivery is no longer the stuff of science fiction.
Hundreds of little robots - knee-high and able to hold around four large pizzas - are now navigating college campuses and city sidewalks in the U.S., the U.K. and elsewhere.
While robots were being tested in limited numbers before the coronavirus hit, companies say pandemic-related labor shortages and a growing preference for contactless delivery have vastly accelerated their deployment.
Starship Technologies has recently completed its 2 millionth delivery.
The company has more than 1,000 robots in its fleet, up from just 250 in 2019. 
Hundreds more will be deployed soon. 
They're delivering food on 20 US campuses, 25 more will be added soon. 
They're also operating on sidewalks in Milton Keynes, England; Modesto, California; and the company's hometown of Tallin, Estonia.
Robot designs vary - some have four wheels and some have six.
But generally, they use cameras, sensors, GPS and sometimes laser scanners to navigate sidewalks and even cross streets autonomously. 
They move around 5 miles per hour.
Remote operators keep tabs on multiple robots at a time, but they say they rarely need to hit the brakes or steer around an obstacle. 
When a robot arrives at its destination, customers type a code into their phones to open the lid and retrieve their food.
The robots have drawbacks that limit their usefulness for now. 
They're electric, so they must recharge regularly. 
They're slow, and they generally stay within a small, pre-mapped radius. 
They're also inflexible. 
A customer can't tell a robot to leave the food outside the door, for example. 
And some big cities with crowded sidewalks, like New York, Beijing and San Francisco, aren't welcoming them.  
Patrick Sheck, a junior at Bowling Green State University in Bowling Green, Ohio, gets deliveries from a Starship robot three or four times a week as he's leaving class. 
""Students love them. They're part of the BG family now. They're recognized all over campus, and they just blend in well with the student population,"" Sheck says.
""The robot pulls up just in time for me to get some lunch,"" he adds
Bowling Green and Starship charge $1.99 plus a service fee for each robot delivery.
""It's gone from being really just a nice thing to have to really more of an essential service. And our students are loving it,"" says Frank Comery from Starship technologies.
Delivery companies are also jumping into the market. 
Grubhub recently partnered with Russian robot maker Yandex to deploy 50 robots on the campus of Ohio State University in Columbus, Ohio. 
Grubhub plans to add more campuses soon, although the company stresses that the service won't go beyond colleges for now.
Yandex used technology developed for its self-driving cars to build and deploy more than 100 robots globally over the last year. 
It's also testing the robots in Moscow and Israel.
""I think, right now, we're at that point where, for something like these delivery rovers, the technology, we believe, is really ready to roll out in a big way,"" said Toby Snuggs, Yandex's head of sales, noting the uptick in demand for meal delivery during the pandemic.
U.S. delivery orders jumped 66% in the year ending in June. 
That's according to NPD, a data and consulting firm. 
And delivery demand could remain elevated even after the pandemic eases, because customers have gotten used to the convenience.

ilRArJc-6eo,sd,"(3 Nov 2021) Anxious families waited for news on Wednesday about loved ones trapped under the rubble of a 21-storey building that collapsed in Lagos as the search and rescue continued for a third day.
The death toll from the collapse of the block under construction in Nigeria’s most populous city rose to 23 with two more bodies recovered Wednesday afternoon, authorities said.
Hazeez Olalere remained hopeful for his relative, Babatunde Olalere, who worked as a mason at the construction site. 
Babatunde did not return home to his wife and baby on Monday and after repeated calls to his number with no response the family is devastated.
""I personally called his number yesterday, and the first response I got was 'switched-off', on the second attempt the call went through and rang repeatedly with no response, so later we learnt about the incident at his place of work,"" Hazeez said.
The president of the Architects Regulation Council of Nigeria, Dipo Ajayi, told The Associated Press that sub-standard building work was likely responsible for the collapse.
It is still unclear the number of people at the construction site when the building came down.
Nine people had been rescued by Tuesday, but no new survivors were found Wednesday.

DZyGvWSaLCg,sd,"(1 Nov 2021) Thailand on Monday substantially reopened to foreign tourists, some 18 months after effectively closing its borders against the coronavirus, raising hopes of economic revival in a country more dependent than most on the spending power of overseas visitors.  
A steady stream of inbound passengers bustled though Bangkok international airport's previously almost deserted public areas.
Fully vaccinated tourists from 63 countries and territories can now fly in, with minimal conditions. 
They take a COVID test on arrival then spend one night in a designated hotel, awaiting the result. 
If their test is negative they are free to leave and enjoy their stay unhindered.
So far so good for Bruce Stiles, from the UK, who had just got off a flight from London.
""Yeah it was OK. It was pretty smooth. We knew it would take a while"" to pass through the airport on arrival, he said.
Those from countries outside the list of 63 can still enter but have to go through lengthy quarantine periods, upon arrival, as well as frequent tests.
According to the general manager of Bangkok's international airport, around 2,300 people are expected there from international flights on Monday. 
""I think it is a good sign for starting after we have had COVID and after today I think Thais will have a future,"" said Kittipong Kittikachorn, the general manager of Suvarnabhumi Airport, who admitted to nervousness as he watched the passengers filter through.
With crowds of tourists absent from the streets, it's been a desperate time for Thailand's vast hospitality sector. 
It accounted for an estimated 12-20% of GDP before the coronavirus pandemic.
Not now. 
With tight entry restrictions in place, visitor numbers plummeted from almost 40 million in 2019, to just 6.7 million in 2020. 
The result: shuttered bars, restaurants and hotels, and worker lay-offs. Even places that have survived, like this restaurant near Bangkok's Grand Palace, have taken on huge debt.
Thai Restaurant Association president Taniwan Koonmongkon spells out how hard the industry's been hit.
""For the period that restaurants didn't have income, if it had only been one or two months, they could probably have survived. But restaurants were closed, then opened, then ordered closed again, like this, for almost two years now. We've endured such severe hardship,"" she said.
The re-opening then is raising spirits, right across the ailing sector.
This city centre hotel has survived by providing quarantine facilities. Now it's preparing for new guests under the re-opening initiative and looking towards a more stable future.
""I expect customers will return as normal after 1 November,"" says Wassana Chitapiwantha, the deputy manager. ""They will book with us like they used to. Staff who were laid off during the shutdown will come back to work when we open hundred percent with a full service.""
Bangkok tuk-tuk driver Boonyeam Markthong has seen his daily income drop from as much as 3,000 baht (approximately 90 US dollars) to almost zero, some days. Now he hopes the nightmare is ending.
But there remains substantial concern that the growing influx of visitors will cause a spike in COVID-19 cases, just as the country is getting its latest outbreak under control. 
For many Thais, public health still outweighs concern over the economy.

dCmhkgPy0lA,sd,"(1 Nov 2021) Peruvians had hoped this year they'd be able to resume their Day of the Dead traditions of visiting the gravesites of their loved ones. 
But health and local authorities decided to close most cemeteries in Peru to prevent a third wave of COVID-19, which has already claimed the lives of more than 200-thousand people.
The Nueva Esperanza cemetery on the outskirts of Lima, known as Virgen de Lourdes, is among the largest in the world, with over one million tombs, and it's located in one of Lima's most impoverished neighborhoods. 
Some residents attempted to climb hillsides and use other unauthorized passages used to gain entrance but were stopped by armed security forces. 
Visiting loved one's tombs on the Day of the Dead is a tradition for many in Peru and other Latin American countries. 
People tend to eat and drink and pay tribute to the deceased on the Day of the Dead every November.

w59DwtY6w-w,sd,"(31 Oct 2021) A beauty pageant competition in Venezuela on Saturday offered the young men who were competing a chance to temporarily escape the harsh realities experienced by many in the country. 
Nineteen men took part in the Mr. Handsome Venezuela International pageant in Caracas, showing off their dancing and other skills.  
The pageant this year was attended by some media and special guests after last year's edition was cancelled due to COVID-19.
Rafael Sanchez, the representative of the state of Lara, was announced as the winner.
Another participant, Renzo Guaramato, spoke of his love for modelling. 
""It's not easy to do what you like, it's part of the sacrifice, but when you can, when you want to, you do your best,"" Guaramato said. 
He recalled the time he had to travel on a garbage truck since he lacked the money to pay for public transportation and had even gone hungry at times. 
""But that didn't stop me from being here. You know that the effort and dedication and love for modeling is more than the challenges I had in the journey,"" he said. 
Alirio Martinez, the President of Mr. Handsome Venezuela, said the participation and training the young men receive has catapulted some into the world of entertainment. 
""This is like a trampoline. Mr. Handsome is like a trampoline for the young men of Mr. Handsome Venezuela, the participants. It is a school, it is a university where they learn to develop in the artistic environment,"" Martinez said.

Yahoo Inc. said Tuesday it has pulled out of China, citing an increasingly challenging operating environment.
The withdrawal was largely symbolic, as many of the company's services were already blocked by China's digital censorship. But recent government moves to expand its control over tech companies generally, including its domestic giants, may have tipped the scales for Yahoo.
""In recognition of the increasingly challenging business and legal environment in China, Yahoo's suite of services will no longer be accessible from mainland China as of November 1,"" the company said in a statement. It said it ""remains committed to the rights of our users and a free and open internet.""
The company's move comes as the American and Chinese governments feud over technology and trade. The U.S. has put restrictions on telecom giant Huawei and other Chinese tech companies, alleging that they have ties with China's government, military or both. China says the U.S. is unfairly suppressing competition and trying to block China's technological rise.
Yahoo is the latest foreign tech company to exit China. Google gave up several years ago, and Microsoft's professional networking platform LinkedIn said last month it would shutter its Chinese site, replacing it with a jobs board instead. The departures illustrate the choices internet companies face in a huge potential market, but one where the government requires them to censor content and keywords deemed politically sensitive or inappropriate.
In their place, Chinese companies have filled the void, creating an alternative internet with its own digital giants. The Baidu search engine has largely replaced Yahoo and Google in China, and WeChat and Weibo are the leading social media platforms.
Yahoo's departure coincided with the implementation of China's Personal Information Protection Law, which limits what information companies can gather and sets standards for how it must be stored.
Chinese laws also stipulate that companies operating in the country must hand over data if requested by authorities, making it difficult for Western firms to operate in China as they may also face pressure back home over giving in to China's demands.
Yahoo was harshly criticized by lawmakers in the U.S. in 2007 after it handed over data on two Chinese dissidents to Beijing, eventually leading to their imprisonment.
Yahoo had previously downsized its operations in China, dropping a music and email service in the early 2010s and shuttering its Beijing office in 2015. Anyone who tried to access Engadget China, a tech news site that it had continued to operate, was greeted Tuesday with a popup saying the site would no longer publish content.
China has also blocked most international social media sites and search engines, such as Facebook and Google. Some users in China circumvent the block by using a virtual private network (VPN) that masks who you are and where you are logging in from.
Verizon Communications Inc. acquired Yahoo in 2017 and merged it with AOL, but later sold the entity off to private equity firm Apollo Global Management in a $5 billion deal. Apollo announced in September that its acquisition of Yahoo was complete.

Jitender Saxena, 47, who works in a shop and is an ardent supporter of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, said he won't be surprised if India achieves the goal much earlier than 2070. 
""Today, anywhere that Modi goes, the whole world is looking up to him,"" he said.  
Modi announced the target Monday at the U.N. climate summit in Glasgow, Scotland.
He said the goal of reaching ""net zero"" by 2070 was one of five measures India planned to undertake to meet its commitments under the Paris climate accord.

Dwayne Johnson says his production company Seven Bucks will no longer use real guns on any set, following death of ""Rust"" cinematographer Halyna Hutchins.
""Moving forward on any Seven Bucks production, in television or film or otherwise, we will not use real guns ever again. We are going to be using rubber guns and we'll take care of it in post,"" Johnson said, at the Los Angeles premiere for ""Red Notice,"" Wednesday (3 NOVEMBER 2021).
""And we won't worry about the dollars, we won't worry about math and what the cost is. I think we're going to do it the right way,"" the actor and producer added.
Hutchins was fatally shot by Alec Baldwin on the ""Rust"" set in New Mexico last month. Investigators believe Baldwin's gun fired a single live round that killed the cinematographer and wounded director Joel Souza.
Johnson said the tragedy will be a catalyst for change. 
""It's created a new lens and new perspective on how we can operate moving forward. We have to use, as awful as this situation was and is, we have to use this as an example and I think in a way to be smarter as we move forward, be safer,"" he said. 
In action comedy ""Red Notice,"" Johnson plays an FBI profiler who is after the two biggest art thieves in the world, played by Ryan Reynolds and Gal Gadot. 
Reynolds said the long off-screen friendship between the stars prevented any ego clashes on set. 
""I've known Dwayne for 21 years now. So, you know, he and I first met, he was doing 'Scorpion King', I was doing 'Van Wilder'. It was a really long time ago, So we all kind of know each other is a built-in chemistry, but it was just love. I mean, truly a love fest. I know that like you probably hear that a lot from actors in my position, but it really was amazing. The set was just a lovely place to work and play.""
Reynolds also discussed his recent announcement on social media that he will temporarily step away from acting, to focus on his family. 
""I don't know exactly when I'll be back, but I've got to take a little bit of time just like my kids are growing up,"" he said. 
""We usually all travel together when we shoot films and they're in school, so they can't do that now, so I just needed to be home and, you know, I'm really fortunate that I am able to do that. Not everyone can do that. So, you know, it's just nice to be close for a little while.""
Written and directed by Rawson Marshall Thurber, ""Red Notice"" is out on Netflix on November 12.

13TmcAR5jos,sd,"(3 Nov 2021) LEAD IN:
Scientists are studying a unique frozen archive of Greenland's ice sheet.
They're searching for clues to Earth's past and our planet's warmer future, as a result of temperature-rising climate change.
In recent decades, the archive's worth to scientists has increased, as climate change and rising temperatures eat away at Greenland's glaciers, contributing to global sea level rise.

STORY-LINE:
The University of Copenhagen's Niels Bohr Institute is home to a library of Greenlandic ice cores. 
Scientists from Denmark, which rules Greenland, have been regularly visiting the giant frozen island since the 1970s, bringing back deep-drilled, tube-shaped ice cores to study in sophisticated laboratories back home. 
If stacked end-to-end, the large, frosty collection would now stretch more than 20 kilometres. It is kept constantly chilled in large freezers at minus 30 degrees Celsius.
""All the metrological measurements and atmospheric measurements humans and have done in the last hundred years or so are already influenced by climate change that is human caused,"" explains Bo Vinther, an associate professor at the Niels Bohr Institute. 
""So, if we want to see the natural state of climate and natural variability, then we need to go way, way further back in time, and our archives provide this window into the past.""
An international team of scientists is now studying not the frozen ice chunks, but frosty deposits of muddy sediment and pebbles that once lay 1.4 kilometres beneath the ice sheet's surface.
The samples sat largely forgotten in cold storage for decades after being drilled by U.S. scientists in the 1960s, as part of work to establish a military base within the Greenland Ice Sheet at the height of the Cold War. They were ""rediscovered"" three years ago.
While the brown-coloured basal sediment samples - each about the size of a football - might not be much to look at, the team's Andrew Christ, a glacial geomorphologist from the University of Vermont, describes the ancient rubble as a ""time capsule"".
""By cracking open these sediments for the very first time, we're able to learn more about what it used to be like in the past,"" he says.
The team plans to use a method known as luminescence dating to learn how long ago the sediment's mineral grains were last exposed to direct sunlight. 
Combined with other measurements, it could reveal temperatures when the Greenland Ice Sheet last melted away. Initial results reported last year suggested the ice sheet had been absent within the last million years.
""With this research, we are hoping to learn more about past times when this part of Greenland melted away and then understand what climate was like at those times,"" explains Christ. 
""How much warmer was it at that point? What was different about Earth's climate system at those times versus today? And what does that tell us about how sensitive Greenland is to melting in the future?""
Working in almost complete darkness and lit by the glow of a red-coloured bicycle light, Christ and his colleague Pierre-Henri Blard from CNRS, the French National Centre for Scientific Research, carefully saw into the frozen soil samples, dividing them into smaller chunks for transport back to U.S. labs - even the slightest exposure to sunlight could throw their readings millennia off.
The team's work is timely. Delegates are meeting in Glasgow, Scotland for the delayed U.N. COP26 climate summit. It's been billed as a ""last hope"" to keep the emission-cutting commitments made in the 2015 Paris climate accord. 
""So, for that, we have to look into the past.""

vB0PubKXNcw,sd,"(4 Nov 2021) Voters in the US state of New Jersey reacted on Wednesday to the news that Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy narrowly won reelection in his reliably blue state. 
Murphy eked out a victory against GOP challenger Jack Ciattarelli, who mounted a surprisingly strong campaign on issues including taxes and opposition to pandemic mask and vaccination mandates. 
Murphy, in a brief victory speech Wednesday night, alluded to his narrow margin of victory by saying he would “listen to all of New Jersey,” but still emphasized Democratic goals like expanding voting rights, raising taxes on the wealthy and defending abortion rights.
New Jersey voter Matthew Kessler, a 27-year-old Democrat and Murphy supporter, said the close race didn't surprise him.
""The pandemic has really been a polarizing issue, so it's not too surprising to me that it was as close of a race,"" he said.
Terry Ferguson, also a Murphy supporter, mentioned the polaizing and divisive state of politics around the US, but expressed surprise that it came into play in his home state.
""I think that it's sort of a reflection of the polarization and politicization within the the country as a whole. But I had not imagined that it would be so close here or so evident in New Jersey,"" he said.
Ferguson also expressed confidence in the US electoral system.

Hundreds participated in the funeral of Sabah Fakhri, one of the Arab world's most famous singers, in Damascus on Thursday.

STORY-LINE:
Syria on Thursday held a major public funeral for the legendary singer Sabah Fakhri, who died this week at 88. 
Hundreds of people poured into the streets in Damascus to bid farewell to the Syrian tenor, who had entertained generations with traditional songs and preserved extinct forms of Arabic music. 
The body of the great artist was escorted from the capital's al-Shami Hospital, wrapped in the national flag.
Men carried his coffin on their shoulders and marched in a solemn procession in Damascus's Umayyad Square where funeral prayers were held. 
The procession then continued to Aleppo, Syria's second largest city and Fakhri's hometown.   
Fakhri died on Tuesday. The cause of death was not immediately known. 
He was born Sabah Abu Qaws in the Syrian city of Aleppo in 1933 and got his stage name as an adolescent performer.
Fakhri was a world class Tarab singer, an Arabic form of music associated with emotional evocation that can last for hours.  
On stage, Fakhri would engage the audience and sway to the music almost in a trance, turning the lyrics of his songs, often in classical Arabic, into refrains they could easily sing back to him.  
He once performed for 10 hours straight in 1968 at a concert in Caracas, Venezuela, without a single break, earning an entry in the Guinness Book of World Records.

Tiny and suffering from malnutrition, Mohebullah's life was on the brink, but doctors in Mirbacha Kot, a small district hospital outside Kabul, have managed to save him.
The same health workers continue to work without salaries, without medicine and with frequent power cuts as Afghanistan's economy crumbles.
In Mirbacha Kot, they have not been paid in five months.
Many of the medical staff feel they have no choice but to carry on as there is nowhere else for them to find work.  
Mohammed Javid Ahmadi, the 22-year-old recently-appointed Taliban supervisor of the hospital, has big plans for it, to the dismay of the doctors who work there.
Fresh from a war that has spanned most of his life, Ahmadi was asked by his superiors what kind of jobs he could do.
He was given the hospital from the gamut of ministries and institutions now under the Taliban's power following August's blitz takeover of the country.
The first order of his day is the registration book - Ahmadi wants every doctor to sign in and out.
It's a formality most health workers are too busy to remember, but neglecting it is enough to make Ahmadi angry.
The second is planning to build a mosque in the hospital grounds.
Workers come to the hospital to take measurements and Ahmadi gives them orders.
""We are Muslims, and we have 32 staff members, and for them, we need a mosque,"" he said.
""There are multiple benefits,"" he added.
Relatives can stay with sick patients overnight as the hospital lacks extra beds especially during the winter months, ""and this is what is needed the most,"" Ahmadi stated.
Doctors, lacking basic equipment and salaries do not seem to be in agreement.
For Sabour Babakarkhil, the director of Mirbacha Kot hospital, it is a situation he is sadly familiar with.
""I remember during the past regime of the Taliban we faced similar problems. During that time I worked in a hospital, the hospital didn't have anything,"" he said.

YEvyvI4hDvM,sd,"(2 Nov 2021) Palestinian families in a tense neighborhood of Jerusalem on Tuesday rejected an offer that would have delayed their eviction by Jewish settlers. 
The families' plight helped ignite protests and clashes earlier this year that eventually led to the 11-day Gaza war. 
During a news conference on Tuesday in Sheikh Jarrah, the families said their decision springs from ""our belief in the justice of our cause and our right to our homes and our homeland.""
The proposal floated by Israel's Supreme Court earlier this month would have made them ""protected tenants"" blocking any eviction and demolition order for at least the next 15 years, according to Ir Amim, an Israeli rights group that closely follows developments in the city.
But it would have forced them to acknowledge the settlers' ownership of the properties, which could weaken the families' case going forward.
The four families are among dozens in Jerusalem who are threatened with eviction by Jewish settler organizations in several cases that are at various legal stages. 
The settlers are making use of an Israeli law that allows them to claim properties that were owned by Jews prior to the 1948 war surrounding Israel's creation. 
Palestinians who lost homes, properties and lands in the same conflict do not have the right to recover them.
Israel captured east Jerusalem along with the West Bank and the Gaza Strip in the 1967 war. 
The Palestinians want all three territories to form their future state and consider east Jerusalem their capital.
Israel annexed east Jerusalem shortly after the 1967 war and considers the entire city to be its capital, a claim not recognized by most of the international community.

Added music producer and writer Jimmy Jam, ""I think the diversity of this class is wonderful, and as it should be. I mean, everybody has their opinion about what rock and roll is. I know a lot of people think that it's a white guy with a guitar, you know? Oh, I think it's so much broader than that, and I think it should want to be looked at much broader than that because to me, it should be known only about the music, but also about the attitude of the people that make the music.

3eV3esbc3W0,sd,"(3 Nov 2021) CHANEL SHOWCASES ITS LATEST COLLECTION WITH A RUNWAY SHOW IN DUBAI
The iconic French label Chanel drew throngs of guests including some celebrities to view the brand's latest resort collection with a runway show in Dubai Tuesday (2 NOVEMBER). The collection was defined by its iconic stark two-tone pieces.  
It marked the second time Chanel has held a runway show for one of its cruise collections in Dubai, a global hub and shopping mecca that beckons jet-setting fashionistas and style mavens.
The Chanel Cruise 2021/22 collection by creative director Virginie Viard was first unveiled virtually in May due to the coronavirus pandemic. This time, it was shown to a live audience for the first time in Dubai. All guests in attendance had to prove to be fully vaccinated for COVID-19 or provide a negative PCR test.
The fashion for this collection was inspired by the label's founder, Gabrielle ""Coco"" Chanel, and her friendship with French filmmaker and visual artist Jean Cocteau. Specifically, the collection drew inspiration from a black and white experiential film he directed in 1960.
The ready-to-wear collection mirrored the era's modern and punk sensibilities with pieces distinguished by leather, fringes, beads, sequins, and Chanel's iconic tweed suit pieces. A few of the bags from the collection also included fringe, as well as redefined details on the label's quintessential black quilted leather style. The shoes included pointed metallic-wedged Mary Janes and mid-calf, gold-tipped booties. Accessories included a black leather garter with a small attached purse with Chanel's double-C logo.
The fashion on the runway was matched only by the fashion off the runway as the show's Chanel-clad guests, many of whom are loyal customers of the brand, sashayed through adjacent doors to the after-party, which featured a surprise performance by singer John Legend. Other celebrities in attendance included actress Penelope Cruz, as well as several Arabic-language movie stars. The diverse crowd of Lebanese, French, South Asian, Korean and others included many who'd flow in for the event.

Three months after torrential rains flooded much of central China's Henan province, stretches of the country's flat agricultural heartland are still submerged in several inches of water. 
It's one of the many calamities around the world that are giving urgency to the UN climate summit under way in Glasgow, Scotland.
In the hardest hit areas of Henan, farmers are struggling after the floods destroyed most of their harvest. 
Some of the corn ears can be salvaged, but because the husks are moldy, they can be sold only as animal feed at lower prices.
Hou Beibei's greenhouse garden of eggplants, garlic and celery remain flooded three months after the rains. 
""We have been working so hard, breaking our backs … without even a penny back, my heart aches,"" said Hou. 
A 58-year-old farmer who gave only her last name, Song, said everything she owned was submerged by the floods — her home, furniture, fields, farming equipment.
""Ordinary people suffer the most,"" she said. 
The disaster was also a preview of the kind of extreme conditions the country is likely to face as the planet warms and the weather patterns growers depend upon are increasingly destabilized. 
China, the most populous country in the world, with 1.4 billion people, is now the planet's largest contributor to climate change, responsible for around 28% of carbon dioxide emissions that warm the Earth, though the United States is the biggest polluter historically.
As world leaders take part this week in the climate summit, China is being criticized for not setting a more ambitious timeline for phasing out fossil fuels.
President Xi Jinping, who has not left China since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic and will not be attending the summit but sent a veteran negotiator, has said the country's carbon emissions will level off before 2030. Critics say that's not soon enough.
Chinese government projections paint a worrying vision of the future: rising sea levels threatening major coastal cities, including Shanghai, Guangzhou and Hong Kong, and melting glaciers and permafrost imperiling western China's water supply and grand infrastructure projects such as the railroads across the Tibetan plateau.
Top government scientists also predict an increase in droughts, heat waves and extreme rainfall across China that could threaten harvests and endanger reservoirs and dams, including Three Gorges Dam.
Meanwhile, China's people are already suffering the brunt of climate change. And in a common pattern around the world, those who have contributed least to the warming and have the fewest resources to adapt often feel the pain most acutely.
In late July, Chinese news broadcasts carried startling footage of torrential rains swamping Henan's provincial capital, Zhengzhou — at one point, 8 inches (20 centimeters) fell in a single hour — with cars swept away, subways flooded and people struggling through waist-deep water. 
More than 300 people died as the megacity turned into an accidental Venice, its highways transformed into muddy canals.
Even after the most dramatic storms ceased, the water continued to pool in much of the surrounding countryside, a flat and fertile region.
Here the economy depends on corn, wheat and vegetables, and other regions of China depend on Henan for food. The local government reported that nearly 3 million acres (1.2 million hectares) of farmland were flooded — an area about the size of Connecticut — with damage totaling $18 billion.

YN-oUBXZ0lM,sd,"(2 Nov 2021) LEAD IN:
China's Huawei Technologies Co. is gearing up to provide smart services and 5G technology to industries such as healthcare for new revenue streams that might offset the damage to its smartphone business from U.S. sanctions. 
In the southern city of Guangzhou, the company has teamed up with a Chinese hospital to equip it with 5G technology and more than 10,000 smart devices that can collect and transmit real-time health data from patients to doctors and nurses to improve patient care. 

STORY-LINE:
This ambulance may look just like any other from the outside, but its on board medical devices are connected to 5G.
5G is an ultra-fast wireless technology that has little lag time and can support a massive number of smart devices connected to the internet simultaneously. The current mainstream technology, 4G, is slower at transmitting data and can support fewer devices.
The hospital in Guangzhou, a city of 15 million, uses various smart technologies, including this 5G ambulance. It is fitted with medical devices and cameras to transmit data and footage in real time, allowing doctors to make better diagnoses while patients are on their way to the hospital so they can be treated as soon as they arrive
In the case of a chest pain patient, their electrocardiogram can be immediately be sent back to the hospital where a cardiologist can review it and make an accurate diagnosis. 
If it suggests a heart attack, the hospital can prepare for an operation to be conducted as soon as the patient arrives.
""After the electrocardiography is done, the doctor in the ambulance can see it, and at the same time, people in the hospital, for example the cardiologists, can see the electrocardiogram too,"" says Liu Xingtao, chief physician and director of the emergency department the Guangdong Second Provincial General Hospital.
""This way, accurate diagnosis can be made. For example, this is a patient with chest pain, and electrocardiography is done (in the ambulance). And what does the electrocardiogram say? It suggests acute myocardial infarction. After a cardiologist examines (the electrocardiogram), the hospital can immediately activate the catheterisation laboratory. Once the patient arrives at the hospital, they can bypass both the emergency department and CCU (coronary care unit) and go to the catheterisation laboratory directly to receive emergency percutaneous coronary intervention. In this case, there will be a higher chance for a successful rescue.""
According to Liu, thanks to the 5G ambulance, the time between a patient's arrival at the hospital and the conduction of an operation is reduced by around half an hour.
Without 5G, the transmission of medical data is slower, and some data could be lost due to bandwidth limitations.
Real-time monitoring and quicker diagnoses are also transforming the way that medical care is provided to inpatients at the hospital.
Now, doctors are able to monitor heart rates in real time, send an alert once there are abnormal signs and react accordingly much quicker.  
""No, you couldn't do real-time (monitoring). But now we are able to (monitor) in real time. When you're (only) carrying a device, I won't be able to see anything. In the worst-case scenario, if a patient passes out, we won't know what his/her heart rate is. With real-time (monitoring), we are able to learn about what's going on with a patient's heart rate and can immediately instruct them about what to do,"" says He Yongcong, a physician at the hospital's cardiovascular medicine department.
Altogether, the hospital can monitor the heart rate of around 400 patients at the same time.

qV_n1iRf5DY,sd,"(3 Nov 2021) Hundreds of people blocked the streets of Ukraine's capital Wednesday to protest mandatory vaccination and new restrictions for non-vaccinated residents.
Around 500 protesters marched to the Ukrainian parliament building with placards urging the government to respect people's right not to get jabbed.
Starting Monday, Kyiv's authorities restricted access to public transport and venues for people who remain unvaccinated against COVID-19, in a bid to bolster the sluggish rate of vaccination in the country.
Non-vaccinated residents will no longer be able to go to work and visit public places unless they have tested negative for the coronavirus.
Restaurants, hotels and fitness centers will remain open if 100% of the employees are vaccinated or have negative daily tests.
Ukraine has one of the slowest paces of vaccinations in Europe.
Only around 17% of population have been fully vaccinated.
Ukraine has reported 23,393 new coronavirus cases Monday, bringing the country's total to more than 2.9 million.

MrAIdRND8Gw,sd,"(4 Nov 2021) Republican Winsome Sears, who returned to Virginia politics after an absence of nearly two decades, has become the first female lieutenant governor and the first woman of color to win statewide office in Virginia.
Sears, who used her acceptance speech to priase her family, her Jamaican roots and her faith in God, says she also wants to be an inspiration.
""In case you haven't noticed, I am Black and I have been Black all my life,"" she says of her historic win.
Sears defeated Democrat Hala Ayala in Tuesday's election. Ayala also would have been the first woman of color to hold statewide office if she had won. 
The Republican rocketed out of political obscurity earlier this year when she won the GOP nomination on the strength of a campaign photo in which she posed holding a military rifle.
Sears will succeed Democrat Justin Fairfax, who unsuccessfully ran for governor. Her role as a tiebreaking vote in a closely divided state Senate has become even more important given GOP victories in other races. Republicans won the governor's mansion, and the party is also claiming that it has regained control of the House of Delegates, though several key races are still too early to call.
If Republicans do gain control of the House, the only thing blocking them from total control of state government is a narrow 21-19 Democratic advantage in the state Senate. Senators are not up for reelection until 2023.
A former Marine, Sears had a brief stint in electoral politics 20 years ago as a one-term delegate in the General Assembly, representing parts of Hampton Roads. Her return to politics after a two-decade absence began when she served as national chairperson for Black Americans to Re-Elect President Trump.
Throughout the race, Sears also highlighted her background as a Jamaican immigrant, campaigning against illegal immigration and rejecting the notion that the nation is plagued by systemic racism.
She said she will work to fully fund historically Black colleges and implement Youngkin's agenda.
Ayala conceded early Wednesday afternoon in a statement on Twitter.
During the campaign, Ayala criticized Sears for refusing to say whether she had been vaccinated against the coronavirus. Sears ridiculed mask mandates during the primary.
Sears won despite being badly outgunned financially — reports showed Ayala's campaign more than doubled Sears in fundraising, with $6.4 million raked in by Ayala, compared with $2.6 million for Sears.
Both the attorney general and the lieutenant governor posts have served as launching pads to the governor's mansion. Half of the past 10 lieutenant governors in Virginia have gone on to be governor. The previous nine elected attorneys general all ran for governor.

William and his charity, The Royal Foundation, launched the Earthshot Prize last year, inspired by President John F. Kennedy's 1962 ""Moonshot"" speech that challenged and galvanized Americans to go to the moon.
The prize, to be awarded to five winners every year until 2030, is billed as the most prestigious of its kind.  Each winner will receive a grant worth 1 million pounds ($1.4 million) to develop and scale up their ideas.

Ewjm0hTh8FQ,sd,"(1 Nov 2021) PAUL WESLEY AND IAN SOMERHALDER PLAYED BROTHERS ON 'VAMPIRE DIARIES' AND NOW THEY CO-OWN A BOURBON COMPANY
Actors Paul Wesley and Ian Somerhalder played vampire brothers on TV's ""The Vampire Diaries"" for eight seasons and now they have a new project together.
Wesley and Somerhalder have co-founded a bourbon company called, fittingly, Brothers Bond.
On ""The Vampire Diaries,"" their characters drank bourbon together but Wesley says that off-screen, they're both big fans of the liquor.
""It's my drink.  He's a Louisiana boy. It's his drink of choice,"" said the 39-year-old actor, producer and director.
Wesley says the two have kept in touch since the show and live near each other in Los Angeles.  When they formed the company, they learned that making bourbon is not easy.
""I didn't know if we were going to be able to pull it off for a while,"" said Wesley, who played Stefan Salvatore on the supernatural smash hit.  
""And then just suddenly all the little pieces came together and our team was suddenly built and formed... but until we got the juice correct, until we got the mash bill tasting the way that we exactly wanted it, we didn't have anything.  And I remember that day.  We were blending the different mash bills and trying to figure all the stuff out in Ian's house and I just remember one day after months of blending, we looked at each other like, 'Oh, wow, this is that.  We love this.  We love this.'  And that was when really I felt like the company started.""
He says that he and Somerhalder may have the same taste in bourbon but they're actually ""100 percent opposite people"" who complement each other.
""I am glass half-empty.  I am doom and gloom, everything's going to fall apart.  He is everything is amazing, glass half-full, oh my god, everything is unbelievable.  And in a way, it's important to have that yin and yang component when you have, you know, the two co-founders of a company and we balance one another out.  And I think that I wouldn't have it any other way, frankly.  And you know, like true brothers, we sometimes drive each other insane, but we never have these, like - it's funny, we joke, you know, we did the show for eight years.  We're stuck.  We've never had, like, you know, maybe because - we've literally never had a fight.  We argue.  I'm like, 'What are you talking about?  You're a moron,' and he says, 'No, you're a moron,' you know, but we don't do these fights.  We don't have fights.  We don't - there's no, like, major disagreements which is cool.  It's really cool.  We have this kind of, I don't know, it's kind of a unique relationship in that sense,"" said Wesley.

UAmUeXe-ehU,sd,"(3 Nov 2021) South Korean President Moon Jae-in met with his Hungarian counterpart, Janos Ader, Wednesday in Budapest, to discuss bilateral issues, trade relations and their commitments to battling climate change. 
Moon's visit was part of a nine-day European tour, which includes a summit with the leaders of the Visegrad Group, a grouping that includes Hungary, Slovakia, Poland and the Czech Republic, as well as visits to Italy and the United Kingdom.
After arriving in Hungary, Moon paid tribute to the victims of the deadly 2019 'Hableany' tour boat accident on the Danube river in Budapest which claimed the lives of 27 South Korean tourists, one of whom was never recovered.
At a news briefing following talks with Ader, Moon thanked the Hungarian government for its efforts to recover the victims, and for erecting a memorial to the accident on the bank of the Danube where the tragedy took place. 
He also hailed bilateral trade between the two countries, which he said had broken records in 2020 despite the economic downturn caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.
South Korea's relations with Hungary have been elevated to a strategic partner status, Moon said, and praised Ader for his support of peace and denuclearization on the Korean peninsula. 
Ader said at the media briefing that the leaders had discussed points on the agenda of a U.N. climate summit currently underway in Glasgow, Scotland. 
""We have two common points concerning climate change,"" Ader said. ""We both agreed that our countries will be carbon neutral by 2050, and we both think that climate neutrality cannot be achieved without nuclear energy.""
Moon was expected to hold a closed-door meeting with Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban later on Wednesday, according to an official with the prime minister's office.
It was the first state visit of a South Korean president to Hungary since 2001.

Decenas de migrantes que quedaron rezagados de una caravana que viene avanzando desde hace unos días por el sur de México se enfrentaron con piedras y palos a agentes de la Guardia Nacional que intentaban detenerlos. Al menos un oficial resultó herido.
El choque entre los oficiales y los migrantes, en su mayoría centroamericanos, ocurrió a escasos kilómetros del municipio sureño de Pijijiapan, en el estado de Chiapas. Los migrantes continuaban su camino hacia la Ciudad de México.  
La caravana de mayor dimensión que transita por México este año, partió el 23 de octubre de Tapachula, 110 kilómetros más al sur y casi en la frontera con Guatemala.  
Una fuente de la Secretaría de la Defensa Nacional dijo a The Associated Press que la estrategia para desarticular a la caravana será detener a los que se vayan quedando distantes del grueso del contingente. 
Durante el despliegue los elementos militares detuvieron a unos 30 extranjeros y pretendieron ir por otro grupo de migrantes pero este los recibió con palos y piedras obligando a los oficiales a replegarse.
-NAT- migrante que no dio su nombre
Un agente de la Guardia Nacional quedó inconsciente y los mismos migrantes trataron de auxiliarlo.
Pese a que la salud de los migrantes se ha visto afectada por el largo caminar durante 13 días, la mayoría de ellos insisten en no aceptar las visas humanitarias ofrecidas por el gobierno mexicano porque desconfían que sea un engaño para devolverlos a Tapachula o incluso deportarlos a su países de origen.
Los integrantes de la caravana han solicitado residencias permanentes en México y que se les permita el libre tránsito para poder establecerse en cualquier parte del país.

Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger writes in a new book that he understood Donald Trump to be threatening him during a Jan. 2 phone call when Trump asked Raffensperger to help ""find"" enough votes to overturn Trump's loss in Georgia to Democratic President Joe Biden.
Raffensperger's book, ""Integrity Counts"" is being released Tuesday. On display is a man who stood up to pressure from Trump and his supporters, but also a man who's settling some political scores as he tries to survive a hostile Republican primary environment to win reelection in 2022.
An engineer who grew wealthy before running for office, Raffensperger recounts the blow-by-blow struggle in Georgia that followed Biden's narrow victory, including death threats texted to his wife, an encounter when a Georgia state trooper was driving him with men who may have been staking out his suburban Atlanta home, and being escorted out of the Georgia state capitol on Jan. 6 as a handful of right-wing protesters entered the building.
The book climaxes with the phone call, which was recorded and then given to multiple news organizations. Raffensperger — known as a conservative Republican before Trump targeted him — writes that he perceived that Trump was threatening him at multiple points in the phone call.
""I'm not picking a battle with him. He's picking one with me. I'll I've done is said he didn't win the state of Georgia. Twenty-eight thousand people skipped the presidential ballot. What does that have to do with my office? That has to do with his campaign team and the state elections party turning out people to vote. Why did 28,000 Georgians skip the presidential ballot? They didn't vote for anyone. They didn't vote for Biden. They didn't vote for President Trump. They didn't vote for Jo Jorgensen. They skipped it. Yet, they voted down ballot. Whose fault it that?"" Raffensperger told The AP in an interview in his office.

mjjo8dhZRfw,sd,"(4 Nov 2021) Vietnamese authorities said on Thursday that they were in contact with Iranian authorities to resolve the seizure of a Vietnamese oil tanker and to ensure the wellbeing of the crew. 
Pham Thu Hang, a spokesperson for the foreign ministry, said their diplomatic offices were working with Iranian authorities to address the issue. 
Hang said the captain of the seized MV Southys vessel told the Vietnamese embassy in Iran on 27 October, three days after the seizure, that all 26 crew members were being treated well and were in normal health. 
According to two U.S officials, Iran's paramilitary Revolutionary Guard troops took control of the MV Southys on 24 October at gunpoint.
Analysts believe the vessel was trying to transfer Iranian crude oil to Asia, in defiance of sanctions.
U.S. forces had monitored the seizure, but ultimately didn't take action as the vessel sailed into Iranian waters.
It's the latest provocation in Mideast waters as tensions escalate between Iran and the United States over Tehran's nuclear program.

An independent Pentagon review has concluded that the U.S. drone strike that killed innocent Kabul civilians and children in the final days of the Afghanistan war was not caused by misconduct or negligence, and it doesn't recommend any disciplinary action.
The review, done by Air Force Lt. Gen. Sami Said, found that there were some breakdowns in communications and in the process of identifying and confirming the target of the bombing, according to a senior defense official familiar with the report. 
But, Said concluded that the mistaken strike happened despite prudent measures to prevent civilian deaths.
Said's review said the incident must be considered in the context of the moment, as U.S. forces under stress were being flooded by information about threats to troops and civilians at the Kabul airport, just days after a deadly suicide bombing. Thousands of Afghans were swarming the airport, trying to get out the country in the wake of the Taliban takeover.
Said found that better communication between those making the strike decision and other support personnel might have raised more doubts about the bombing, but in the end may not have prevented it. 
Said was asked to investigate the Aug. 29 drone strike on a white Toyota Corolla sedan, that killed Zemerai Ahmadi, and nine family members, including seven children.  Ahmadi, 37, was a longtime employee at an American humanitarian organization.
The intelligence about the car and its potential threat came just days after an Islamic State suicide bomber killed 13 U.S. troops and 169 Afghans at a Kabul Airport gate. The U.S. was working to evacuate thousands of Americans, Afghans and other allies in the wake of the collapse of the country's government.
Said concluded that U.S. forces genuinely believed that the car they were following was an imminent threat and that they needed to strike it before it got closer to the airport.
Said's report, which has been endorsed by Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, made several recommendations for improvements that have been passed on to commanders at U.S. Central Command and U.S. Special Operations Command. 
One of those recommendations is that more be done to prevent what military officials call ""confirmation bias"" — the idea that troops making the strike decision were too quick to conclude that what they were seeing aligned with the intelligence and confirmed their conclusion to bomb what turned out to be the wrong car.
The review recommends that the military have personnel present with the strike team whose job is to actively question such conclusions. The report says that using a so-called ""red-teams"" in such self-defense strikes that are being done quickly, might help avoid errors.
Said also recommeded that the military improve its procedures to ensure that children and other innocent civilian are not present before launching a time-sensitive strike.
For days after the strike, Pentagon officials asserted that it had been conducted correctly, despite mounting reports that multiple civilians and children had died and growing doubts that the car contained explosives. Said's review concluded that officials made their initial assessments too quickly and did not do enough analysis.
While Said's report does not find individual fault or recommend discipline, officials said that commanders may decide to take administrative actions once they review his report.
The U.S. is working to pay financial reparations to the family, and potentially get them out of Afghanistan, but nothing has been finalized.

Zy2iGWuc3Q0,sd,"(1 Nov 2021) 'SQUID GAME' MAKES WAVES IN CHINA DESPITE NOT PASSING CENSORS
A game that offers an opportunity of reliving the horror of ""Squid Game"" has attracted customers to Lynn Xue's lemon tea shop in Beijing since it opened two months ago.  
Xue has reproduced the dalgona game featured in the Netflix's highest rated show. 
The game requires players to carve out a complete shape imprinted on brittle candy, known as dalgona in South Korea, by using a needle.  
The South Korean survival drama depicts a group of desperate debtors competing in a series of traditional children's games, such as dalgona, to win megabucks or die. 
Fortunately, in Xue's shop there is nothing to lose. And customers can be awarded with a glass of lemon tea or another dalgona candy if they do well. 
Retailers on China's biggest e-commers platforms such as Taobao and JD.com have also been inspired to cash in on costumes and other spin-offs from the show. Even clothing sets for pets are available. 
The Chinese mainland is one of a few regions in the world where Netflix is banned. Still, many in the country have watched pirate copies of ""Squid Game"" or used VPNs to log onto Netflix. Over 370,000 viewers marked ""watched"" on Douban, a Chinese social media site popular with movie fanatics, with the show's hashtag on Weibo drawing over two billion views. 
""I think people like to watch horror dramas with bloody and violent images, because China is unable to make good horror dramas,"" says lemon tea shop customer, Tang Qitong. 
To further ape the series, Xue has hung on the shop ceiling a paper imitation of Younghee, a creepy doll in the game ""Red Light, Green Light"", looking down on customers. 
Xue says she's surprised that about 90 percent of the customers coming to her shop have watched the show.
""The sugar is very hot and sticky, and the candy came at a high scrap rate"", said Xue, ""The worst case I had is 51 of 100 candies were broken when they were delivered.""
Chinese state media has criticized the show for its bloody and violent images that they believe could have a negative impact on adolescents. Days later, another report on state media said Netflix has raked in a big fortune from the South Korean production team. 
The criticism made it less likely for ""Squid Game"" to pass censorship and be aired in China officially.

Manchin said he's open to voting for a final bill reflecting Biden's big package ""that moves our country forward."" But he said he's ""equally open to voting against"" the final product as he assesses the overall framework of the sweeping social services and climate change bill.
This as Democrats have made significant progress on adding compromise provisions curbing prescription drug prices to the $1.75 trillion broader package. Democrats hope to resolve their differences vote as soon as this week.

tSAIVyiciRs,sd,"(3 Nov 2021) The UK Minister for the Armed Forces said on Wednesday that the alleged murder of a Kenyan woman by a British soldier had ""let down the British Armed Forces"". 
Kenyan authorities announced Tuesday they would be reopening the case of the murder of Agnes Wanjiru in 2012.
Speaking during a news conference while on a visit to the African country, James Heappey said it was ""important for the UK government to show our solidarity with Agnes' family.""
""I believe that she has a right to justice, her daughter has a right to justice and I think it is perfectly possible that we can meet without prejudicing the case and without admitting culpability,"" he added.
Heappey further said that the UK had nothing to hide as far as the case is concerned and would aid in the investigations accordingly. 
""We need that now to be investigated and brought to the courts here in Kenya as quickly as possible and any further allegations that come to light will be dealt with the same urgency on our part,"" he said.  
Wanjiru's body was found in a septic tank weeks after witnesses said she was seen leaving a bar with British soldiers.
Heappey said that the behaviour of the British military abroad ""reflects the United Kingdom"" and that what had allegedly happened near the Batuk training camp in Nanyuki ""frankly has let down the British Armed Forces.""

3lUPwRcgL3s,sd,"(1 Nov 2021) A young inventor at the UN Climate Change Conference said ""youth plays a big part in solving climate change."" 
Vinisha Umashankar, 14, from India was a finalist of the Earthshot Prize, Prince William's ambitious global environmental award. 
The youngster created a solar-powered ironing cart, offering a clean alternative to charcoal-powered street irons that press clothes for millions daily.
On the streets of rural India, ironing vendors dump burnt, unused charcoal. It has been a way of life for decades.
But where many saw tradition, Vinisha Umashankar, then 12, saw a need for change, having recently learnt about pollution and renewable energy at school.
""In India, we usually put up with inconveniences rather than solving them,"" she told The Associated Press just a day before addressing world leaders at the COP26 climate summit.
While Umashankar did not win first prize her idea is attracting the attention of investors and she says she has a business plan to scale up production.
In Glasgow, she said she wants to call for urgent optimism: a call for rapid action, but with the conviction that every action counts and saving our planet is still possible.

4NDn7Y-BzMs,sd,"(31 Oct 2021) Prime Minister Zoran Zaev announced his resignation late Sunday following the heavy defeat of his governing Social Democratic Union in North Macedonia's local elections.
  
“The responsibility for this outcome is mine and I’m resigning as prime minister and as leader of the Social Democratic Union,” Zaev said at a news conference at party headquarters.
  
Zaev came out against early national elections. Instead, he will support a Social Democrat-led government under a new leader.
  
Although official results were not yet in from the local elections, Zaev conceded defeat in the most important contest - the mayor's race in the capital, Skopje, with incumbent Petre Shilegov losing to a center-right challenger, Danela Arsovska.
  
Candidates supported by the main opposition party, the center-right VMRO-DPMNE, appeared set to win at least half of the country’s 80 municipalities, with the Social Democrats set to win fewer than 20. 
At the last municipal elections, in 2017, the Social Democrats won 57 contests and VMRO-DPMNE only five.

The pair were hosting a meeting on concrete measures that need to be taken in order to put into place the so-called Great Green Wall initiative in Africa.
The ambitious plan seeks to take on the impact of climate change in the belt along the Sahel region with a vast agricultural and ecological program which will span the entire width of the continent.
Prince Charles told attendees the Great Green Wall initiative ""offers a precious opportunity to restore land, forest and biodiversity while also addressing the social, economic, and environmental impact of land degradation and desertification.""
Macron echoed the prince's words, stating the scheme was a chance to tackle climate change but also poverty and terrorism.

Ldm2EMUwrpc,sd,"(31 Oct 2021) An environmental negotiator for some of the poorest and most vulnerable countries said Sunday he was looking to the world's biggest polluters to lead the way with efforts to curb greenhouse gas emissions.
Speaking to the Associated Press at COP26 in Glasgow,  Kevin Conrad, the chairman of the Coalition for Rainforest Nations, said he could ""understand there's a little bit of trepidation"" among the wealthiest nations to making financial commitments amid the economic fallout from the coronavirus pandemic.
But he said it was ""still very disconcerting"" those G-20 countries, which generate around 80% of carbon emissions, were unable to make necessary agreements on climate change when together at events like COP.
Conrad, who is based in Papua New Guinea, said the country was already noticing the effects of global warming and raised concerns about food security.
""It's impacting our fisheries, it's impacting our coastlines, it's impacting our agriculture,"" he said, noting that fish were relocating from Papua New Guinea's waters to cooler seas elsewhere.

PIIT7FJrAyo,sd,"(1 Nov 2021) FOR CLEAN VERSION SEE STORY NUMBER: 4351114

As deadlines loom for military and defense civilians to get mandated COVID-19 vaccines, senior leaders must now wrestle with the fate of those who flatly refuse the shots or are seeking exemptions, and how to make sure they are treated fairly and equally.
  
The vast majority of the active duty force has received at least one shot, but tens of thousands have not. For some it may be a career-ending decision. Others could face transfers, travel restrictions, limits on deployments and requirements to repay bonuses.
  
Exemption decisions for medical, religious and administrative reasons will be made by unit commanders around the world, on what the Pentagon says will be a “case-by-case” basis. That raises a vexing issue for military leaders who are pushing a vaccine mandate seen as critical to maintaining a healthy force, but want to avoid a haphazard, inconsistent approach with those who refuse.
  
The military services are reporting between 1%-7% remain unvaccinated. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin has called for compassion in dealings with those troops, which totals nearly 60,000 active duty service members, according to data released last week.  
Asked about possible variations in the treatment of those seeking exemptions or refusing the vaccine, Pentagon press secretary John Kirby said it’s up to the services. ""Each case is going to be treated specifically and individually as it ought to be,” he said. 
  
It unclear how widely religious exemptions will be granted. Under military rules, commanders can take into account the potential impact on a unit’s mission, and reject a religious exemption if it puts performance at risk.
The Air Force may be the test case in some instances, because they are the first to hit a deadline. The more than 335,000 airmen and Space Force guardians must be fully vaccinated by Tuesday, and the Air Guard and Reserve by Dec. 2. According to Air Force data, as many as 12,000 active duty airmen and guardians were still unvaccinated as of late last week. Some have requested or gotten exemptions, others have refused outright. They have until Monday to request exemptions.
The most successful service has been the Navy, which says that only 1% of the force is unvaccinated as of last week - or about 3,500 sailors. The Air Force and Space Force was second, with 3.6% unvaccinated, followed by the Army and Marine Corps at about 7%.
  
Vaccination numbers fluctuate for the military services, and drop off considerably for the National Guard and Reserve.

Londres - 27 de julio de 2021
STORYLINE: 
Por encima del bullicio de la intersección de Marble Arch en Londres hay una nueva atracción para el público.
Un montículo hueco es la última instalación temporal que permite a los visitantes ver la ciudad desde 25 metros de altura.
SOUNDBITE : Leoni Avison, visitante:
""Creo que es una forma estupenda de conseguir un poco más de espacio verde en un lugar tan concurrido y bullicioso,"" dijo esta turista. ""Y parece que se obtienen unas vistas magníficas de Londres que de otro modo no se tendrían"".
El montículo de Marble Arch está situado en la esquina de Hyde Park; los visitantes ascienden 134 escalones para llegar a la cima.
La instalación, de color verde, forma parte de una campaña más amplia para fomentar las visitas al centro de Londres y revitalizar la escena cultural londinense.
El ayuntamiento de Westminster dice que los materiales utilizados se reciclarán y se utilizarán en otros parques pequeños. Las entradas para adultos a la instalación cuestan el equivalente de 5,5 usd a 11 usd.
A pesar de un aumento de las infecciones de COVID-19 a principios del verano, el gobierno eliminó el 19 de julio la mayoría de las restricciones aún vigentes en interacciones sociales y comerciales.
Sin embargo, los científicos advierten que el público no debe estar satisfecho ya que los altos niveles de infección en la comunidad probablemente provoquen otro aumento de casos en los próximos meses.
El motivo de su pesimismo es la variante delta del COVID-19, que ahora domina en el Reino Unido. Las vacunas son menos efectivas contra esta variante más transmisible, lo que significa que Gran Bretaña debe lograr una mayor tasa de vacunación si espera controlar la enfermedad. Aproximadamente el 60% de la población del Reino Unido ha sido totalmente vacunada.

Large sinkholes at the shores of the Red Sea are threatening local communities and tourists at the lowest point of land on Earth.

STORY-LINE:
Sinkholes keep appearing at the lowest place on Earth – the shores of the Dead See – due to climate change. 
The phenomenon has increased over the past years, making the area unsafe for visitors and locals alike.
The Dead Sea keeps shrinking, and its water level is receding at a rate of about 1.4 meter (4.6 foot) annually.
""The sinkholes keep appearing because of climate change, rising temperatures and because it's a hot area at the shores here,"" said environmental activist Fathi al-Hwaymil.
He said dams built on the tributaries of the Dead Sea and factories located on its shores are causing sea levels to decrease.
""We call on the concerned authorities and international donors to save the Dead Sea as it is the cultural heritage of Jordan,"" the activist added.
Impoverished communities living near the shores of the sea rely on land cultivation and jobs in nearby factories. 
Many farms have become unsafe because of the massive sinkholes.
The sinkholes have also damaged and destroyed many houses, roads and factories. 
They became an obstacle for investment projects in the area.
Spanning 50 kilometers (31 meters) in length and lying 429 meters (1,407 feet) below sea level, the Dead Sea lake is one of the saltiest in the world.
Saad Abu Hammour, a water expert and head of the Friends of the Dead Sea Society, says the area of the Dead Sea has shrunk from 900 square kilometers (347 square miles) to 600 sq km (231 sq miles) in the last three decades.
""The more sea water recedes, the more cracks increase, and the more sinkholes appear,"" the expert said.
Abu Hammour said the Red-Dead Water Conveyance Project, which envisions channeling water from the Red Sea into the Dead Sea, will solve the problems caused by the Dead Sea's depletion, but this project was cancelled.
Due to climate change, a drop in rainfall and droughts are likely to proliferate in the region in the future, he added.

mpBHUSBAklA,sd,"(1 Nov 2021) LEAD IN:
A young Congolese entrepreneur is hoping to tackle mortality rates in the country's mining industry with the help of a new mobile app.
It works in combination with a wearable safety belt to show a miner's location and even the temperature in the underground pit.

STORY-LINE:
Mining is crucial to the Democratic Republic of Congo's economy - known for its rich soil and mineral resources - but work in the mines can be dangerous. Accidents and landslides take dozens of lives every year. 
Entrepreneur Victoire Shukuru knows people who died in the mines. So he has come up with an idea for the app, called ""Min Security"". 
It's a tool that integrates GPS tracking technology with an electronic safety belt connected to a smartphone app.
Miners wear the belt around their waist and, as they go further underground to dig for minerals, managers can track their location for up to one kilometre into the pit. 
This lets them to know the exact whereabouts of the miners in case of an emergency or landslide. 
The mobile app also lets managers monitor the temperature underground and foresee any dangers, such as oxygen shortages.
A group of miners at Mutanga mine, in the Masisi region towards the northwest of the country, believes the app is an important invention that could save lives.
""If at a moment something dangerous were to happen to us down here, they will be alerted quickly on the other side and we will be saved,"" says 35-year-old miner Jean Tafazali, who digs for coltan, cassiterite and tourmaline.
Despite the dangers, men still take the risk as it provides an attractive income.
""Here on the site of Mutanga, we can find coltan,"" explains mine manager, Biyimana Habyarimana, who says he has six mouths to feed. ""This helps us to live, we can buy cattle, fields to cultivate, cows, and we can build houses.""
Shukuru says it was the deaths of people he knew that pushed him to action. 
""Given that I am in the digital field, I said to myself I had to create a digital solution that can help our brothers who – for lack of other opportunities – resort to mining to find a means of survival,"" he says.
The mining activity allows them to earn money and feed their families, but the price for that is sometimes death. 
Sebyera Riziki is a 32-year-old widow mother of five children who lives in Mutanga village. 
""People continue to go to the mines even if they never stop collapsing and each time people die,"" she says.
Her husband died in a mine two years ago. She says it took a toll on her physical and mental health. His death left the family in financial hardship.
""I was very depressed because he would leave and come back with money to help our family. He is so missed, he disappeared down the mine,"" she says, seated outside her home with her children. 
Hopefully, technology will mean fewer women like Riziki have to go through that pain.

PqR7buq3Sso,sd,"(4 Nov 2021) ""Sex and the City"" fans who always imagined what it would be like to be Carrie Bradshaw can now get a better idea by spending a night at a recreated version of her Upper East Side brownstone apartment. 
For just two nights in November, Sarah Jessica Parker in partnership with Airbnb and Warner Bros. Consumer Products, is renting the space to two lucky guests to celebrate and promote the upcoming release of the HBO Max Original ""And Just Like That,"" which marks Carrie's return to the television screen.
Liz DeBold Fusco, of Airbnb, said, ""There are a lot of really special elements here for the fans who are lucky enough to get to book these stays. You can see a cordless phone similar to one that Carrie used to chat hours into the night with her friends. You can see her Carrie necklace sitting by her bedside, of course. You can even type away at Carrie's PowerBook.""
And of course, there's Carrie's fashion-forward closet. ""Guests will be able to enjoy and play dress-up while they spend their night here in the recreated apartment. One item is this white tutu which will look familiar to fans. It's a recreation of the tutu which Carrie Bradshaw famously wore on 'Sex and the Ciy.'"" DeBold Fusco shared.
Parker will virtually host two, one-night stays for up to two guests each  on Nov. 12 and 13. She'll offer a virtual greeting at check-in and a narration reminiscent of each episode's intro.
Requests for the bookings  begin Monday, Nov. 8, at noon ET at airbnb.com/sexandthecity.

Boston voters for the first time elected a woman and an Asian American as mayor, tapping City Councilor Michelle Wu to serve in the city's top office. 
New England's largest city had previously only elected white men as mayor since its founding in 1630 by English puritans. 
Wu defeated fellow Boston City Councilor Annissa Essaibi George. 
The two Democrats faced off against each other after defeating other mayoral hopefuls in a September preliminary election. 
The election of Wu, whose parents immigrated from Taiwan, marks another break from tradition in Boston. 
Wu grew up in Chicago, moving to Boston to attend Harvard University and Harvard Law School. 
Boston typically elects mayors with lifelong Boston roots. 
Wu takes office on Nov. 16.

Non-vaccinated residents of Kyiv will no longer be able to go to work and visit public places unless they have tested negative for the coronavirus.
Restaurants, hotels and fitness centers will remain open if 100% of the employees are vaccinated or have negative daily tests. 
Ukraine has one of the slowest paces of vaccinations in Europe. 
Only around 17% of population have been fully vaccinated.

o6SBpZoe-nk,sd,"(2 Nov 2021) AMERICAN MUSIC AWARDS GET CARDI B TO HOST THE SHOW THIS YEAR
Cardi B has won five American Music Awards and performed on the telecast during her career so far. Next step: hosting the show.
The rapper behind such hits as “Bodak Yellow” and “Money” has been tapped to host the fan-voted awards show airing from Los Angeles on ABC on Nov. 21.
“We are immensely excited to have the dynamic Cardi B bring her infectious energy to the American Music Awards as a first-time host,” said executive producer Jesse Collins in a statement Tuesday.
Cardi B performed “I Like It” at the AMAs in 2018 with J Balvin and Bad Bunny and also made history during her last AMAs appearance, becoming the first female rapper to win Favorite Hip-Hop Song twice. 
Olivia Rodrigo, in the first year she’s eligible, is the leading nominee this time with seven, including artist of the year and new artist of the year. 
Five-time winner The Weeknd has six nominations, going up against Rodrigo in the artist of the year category along with BTS, Ariana Grande, Drake and Taylor Swift.
Reggaeton star Bad Bunny, R&B newcomer Giveon and Doja Cat each have five nominations each. In the new artist of the year category, Rodrigo joins Giveon, 24KGoldn, Masked Wolf and The Kid LAROI.
Swift, who currently holds the record for the most awarded artist in AMA history, could further extend her streak. She is nominated for three awards total, including favorite pop album for “evermore.”
The AMAs added new categories this year, including favorite trending song, favorite gospel artist and favorite Latin duo or group.
Rapper Pop Smoke, who was killed in 2020, is nominated in three categories, including favorite hip-hop album and favorite hip-hop artist, and could win his first award posthumously.

New Jersey Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy narrowly won reelection Wednesday, eking out a victory that spared Democrats the loss of a second gubernatorial seat. 
He’s the state’s first Democratic governor to get a second straight term in 44 years, defeating Republican former Assembly member Jack Ciattarelli.
AP called the race Wednesday evening when a new batch of votes from Republican-leaning Monmouth County increased Murphy’s lead and closed the door to a Ciattarelli comeback.
Ballots remaining to be counted included a significant number of votes from predominantly Democratic Essex County, along with mail-in votes spread across other counties. Murphy has won the mail-in vote by a wide margin even in Republican leaning counties like Monmouth.
Ciattarelli spokesperson Stami Williams disputed the call because of the close margin, calling it “irresponsible.”
Murphy delivered a brief speech in Asbury Park's boardwalk convention hall, nodding to the race's narrow margin by saying he would work for both those who voted for and against him. But there was no trace he planned to scale back the left-leaning positions he's taken during his first term. 
“We shall be judged in the long run not by how we fared in elections, but by what we did as an administration,” Murphy said, quoting Brendan Byrne, the last Democratic governor to be reelected in the state. “Those words will always remind us to always, always, always keep moving forward.” 
Ciattarelli waged a formidable campaign in heavily Democratic New Jersey, his spending nearly equaling  the governor’s and outpacing the GOP’s performance four years ago. But Murphy’s advantages, including 1 million more registered Democrats, proved too much for the Republican to overcome. 
The victory gives Democrats a silver lining after GOP businessman Glenn Youngkin defeated Terry McAuliffe in Virginia’s gubernatorial race - exacerbating worries that President Joe Biden’s sagging approval ratings are hurting the party. This year’s elections were the first major tests of voter sentiment since Biden took office and pointed to a potentially painful year ahead for Democrats as they try to maintain thin majorities in Congress.

N2A4eI3xXWQ,sd,"(2 Nov 2021) Faith leaders and activists across the world are increasingly joining the fight against climate change driven by a moral imperative to preserve creation for future generations.
""We have definitely seen a big increase in the faith based communities joining with indigenous peoples,"" said Chief Shirell Parfait-Dardar of the Grand Caillou and Dulac Band of Biloxi-Chitimacha-Choctaw Indian Tribe, who lives in the costal region of southern Louisiana. She said they're ""standing up and saying, 'wait a minute, God creator blessed us with this planet we should be doing what's responsible.'
The Rev. Kristina Peterson is one of those faith leaders who has partnered with Chief Parfait-Dardar and others in the region to help start initiatives that will reduce the effects of climate change.
""The gospel is not about production and growth, or success,"" said the Rev. Peterson, ""it's about care and love and that connection with the earth and caring for your earth and all that dwell in it.""
One of their current projects, which has been temporarily halted by Hurricane Ida, is to refill canals that have for decades been cut and widened by oil companies. 
""There's a lot of canals, 10,000 miles of canals that have been cut over the years, since about 1950,"" said the Rev. Peterson. ""And so what we're doing is working with a buddhist friend, Jean Turner, whose a professor at LSU. Working with him and working with three tribes to bring that knowledge together of the fishers who are on the water, his knowledge, the knowledge of other folks who have done mapping with how the landscape has changed to see where the most logical place is to refill canals.""
Donald Dardar, of the Pointe-au-Chien Indian Tribe, has been shrimping along these same bayous for decades and provides his lived experience to help the community combat further land erosion. 
""We're heading down Pointe-au-Chien bayou. This side of the bayou is Lafourche and this side is Terrebonne,"" said Dardar pointing from a small fishing boat. ""I don't know must be at least 80, 80 something feet wide,"" he said showing a canal that has drastically changed over the years.
He and other advocates, including his wife and the Rev. Kristina Peterson, have also created living shorelines, another project that utilizes oyster shells to help combat land erosion.
""You can see the oyster bag right here. We did the whole shoreline here,"" Dardar said. ""We had to put that there to protect, otherwise this would all be probably all washed in the water already if we didn't put them bags.""
""We do many things to try and save our community and our burial grounds and all because everything is out of the levy system"" said Dardar's wife, Theresa Dardar of the Pointe-au-Chien Indian Tribe, ""if we don't do anything it will eventually all wash away.""
Many, like the Rev. Peterson, say they're not going to wait for world leaders to take action on the climate crisis, ""we're doing it now,"" she said.
And even after her home was destroyed and projects were put on hold due to Hurricane Ida, which made landfall in late August, Chief Parfait-Dardar continues to join in the climate efforts, fighting to save the community she hopes will be around for her grandchildren. ""I want them to remember that I fought for them, for their home. For their way of life,"" she said.

c_tdrlNYbGQ,sd,"(3 Nov 2021) World leaders have been meeting for 29 years to try to curb global warming, and in that time Earth has become a much hotter and deadlier planet.  
Statistics show trillions of tons of ice have disappeared over that period, the burning of fossil fuels has spewed billions of tons of heat-trapping gases into the air, and hundreds of thousands of people have died from heat and other weather disasters stoked by climate change.
More than 100 world leaders descended on Rio de Janeiro in 1992 for an Earth Summit to discuss global warming and other environmental issues.
That set up the process of international climate negotiations that culminated in the 2015 Paris accord and resumed Sunday in Glasgow, Scotland, where leaders will try to ramp up efforts to cut carbon pollution.
Earth has warmed more in the last 29 years than in the previous 110. Since 1992, the world has broken the annual global high temperature record eight times.  
The yearly global temperature has increased almost 1.1 degrees Fahrenheit (0.6 degrees Celsius) since 1992, based on multi-year averaging, according to the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. 
Climate scientist Gerald Meehl says even a small increase in the global average affects temperature extremes.
""We're twice as likely to set a record high maximum than a record low minimum,"" said Meehl, a senior scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research. ""That's kind of what climate change is, it's kind of shifting the odds towards certain outcomes.""
In the early 2000s, Meehl and his colleagues predicted that heat waves in the 21st century would hit normally temperate regions that had not yet adapted for extreme heat events.
""We looked in the future in a warming climate with increasing greenhouse gases, and we saw these changes in the patterns of future heat waves,"" Meehl said.
That's exactly what happened in the Pacific Northwest in June.  
""It's been estimated that there were over 600 excess heat related deaths in Washington and Oregon alone in one week,"" said Dr. Renee Salas of Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston.
Salas says heat is one of the most visible ways climate change affects health.
""Extreme heat can cause damage to the brain, worsen mental health impacts,"" she said. ""It can affect heart and lung disease, kidney disease.""
And people who are more exposed to heat and less able to adapt are the most vulnerable to those effects.
That includes children and the elderly, who may be more susceptible, as well as workers who frequently labor in the sun and families without air conditioning or access to green spaces.
""In many areas that are low wealth, those communities may not have trees,"" said Sacoby Wilson, an environmental health scientist at the Univeristy of Maryland, College Park. ""Those committees may have older buildings, so they may not have air conditioning, and those communities may have a lot of concrete, a lot of asphalt.""
Both materials absorb then release heat. Trees and other greenery bring area temperatures down. 
Unless top-polluting countries reverse course, heat waves are likely to become more frequent and intense.
""Those kinds of changes are ones that we kind of expected to happen and they have happened,"" Meehl said. ""And they're going to continue to get worse as we go forward.""

hNDgcjVGHIw,hd,"It’s easy to blame the other side. And for many Democrats, it’s obvious that Republicans are thwarting progress toward a more equal society.

But what happens when Republicans aren’t standing in the way?

In many states — including California, New York and Illinois — Democrats control all the levers of power. They run the government. They write the laws. And as we explore in the video above, they often aren’t living up to their values.

In key respects, many blue states are actually doing worse than red states. It is in the blue states where affordable housing is often hardest to find, there are some of the most acute disparities in education funding and economic inequality is increasing most quickly.

Instead of asking, “What’s the matter with Kansas?” Democrats need to spend more time pondering, “What’s the matter with California?”

Disturbing details continue to emerge from rapper Travis Scott's Astroworld music festival, which is now considered one of the deadliest concert tragedies in the United States. 

Eight people died after the crowd surged toward the stage during Scott's performance, including two victims aged 14 and 16 years old. But there are also reports that suggest Scott, despite his own efforts to stop the concert, continued to perform for 37 minutes after police and firefighters responded. 

Jennifer Johnson has the latest details on what may have triggered the panic.

LS9z3kKmVFw,hd,"Drone footage released by the La Palma local government on Tuesday showed a lava stream from the Cumbre Vieja volcano reaching Los Guirres beach after falling from a cliff.

Los Guirres beach, in the town of Tazacorte, is between the delta of lava in the ocean and another stream that has stopped its way into the ocean.

Authorities said it was unclear whether the recent lava stream on the beach was going to create a new delta of lava or if it would join the existing one.

Local authorities said seismicity and the emission of sulphur dioxide from volcano are continuing their downward trend.

Lava has destroyed more than 2,000 properties on the island since the Cumbre Vieja volcano began erupting in mid-September and thousands more have fled their homes as a precaution, prompting the government last month to pledge 225 million euros in aid.

WlQM5GB5Vpk,hd,"Polish riot police reinforced Poland’s eastern border on Tuesday, a day after hundreds of migrants tried to storm across the razor-wire border fence from Belarus into the European Union. Thousands of migrants still remained camped out on the Belarusian side and Polish authorities feared the tense standoff could escalate.

Polish authorities were bracing for further clashes after some migrants used logs, spades and other implements on Monday to try to break down a border fence, escalating a months-long crisis that has prompted calls for tighter sanctions on Minsk.

Poland and other EU member states accuse Belarus of encouraging illegal migrants from the Middle East, Afghanistan and Africa to cross the border into the EU in revenge for sanctions already slapped on Minsk over human rights abuses.

""The Belarusian regime is attacking the Polish border, the EU, in an unparalleled manner,"" Polish President Andrzej Duda told a news conference in Warsaw.

Meanwhile, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko accused the Polish side of trying to intimidate Belarus by moving large military forces closer to the border.

Tens of thousands of Ethiopians rallied on Sunday to denounce the U.S. and other foreign nations and support Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed's government amid the ongoing conflict in the northern part of the country.

Some demonstrators criticized the U.S., which is among the foreign powers calling for a ceasefire as the year-long conflict intensified amid rebel advances last weekend. Others railed against the call by the U.S. for the government and the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF) to begin talks.

On Sunday, Global Affairs Canada said it was withdrawing family members of diplomats and non-essential staff from the country, and urging people to consider leaving the country if they can do so safely.

Ahmed's government has pledged to keep fighting, even as nine groups opposing the government formed an alliance this past Friday.

shyJ97dqfIY,hd,"Toxic foam covered parts of the Yamuna river flowing through India's capital of New Delhi on Tuesday, which according to a local activist, is mostly attributed to illegal dumping of industrial waste and untreated sewage water.

The influx of toxic foam comes as Hindu devotees bathe themselves in the Yamuna to mark the Chhath Puja, a religious festival to thank the Sun God for bestowing bounties of life on the earth. Women were seen bathing and praying amongst clouds of foam.

According to activist Varun Gulati, the denim industries, most of which are illegally set up in residential areas in the capital city are discharging more polluted water into sewage treatment plants than allowed and the violations continue unmonitored.

The New Delhi government's Water Supply Board blamed industrial waste and untreated pollutants from neighbouring Haryana and Uttar Pradesh states for the Yamuna's worsening pollution.

Buzbee revealed Acosta's cause of death, stating the young man died of compressive asphyxiation due to the weight of the crowd pushing, and he then collapsed due to cardiac arrest and was trampled on. ""The air was literally slowly squeezed out of him,"" said the lawyer. 

He did not clarify if the cause of death was determined by an autopsy.

Buzbee added his firm will be filing a lawsuit on behalf of 35 plaintiffs — and that number is “growing” — following the tragedy. Parties getting sued involve the promoters of the festival, the security company and more.

QkWr3JXPyK0,hd,"Four astronauts splashed down off the coast of Florida in a SpaceX capsule on Tuesday after a six-month stay aboard the International Space Station (ISS) and a day-long flight home. 

The Dragon vehicle, dubbed Endeavour, parachuted into the sea as planned following a fiery re-entry descent through Earth’s atmosphere. 

Eyewitness videos showed the capsule streaking across the night sky over New Orleans as it made its way back to Earth.

Applause was heard from the flight control centre as the four main parachutes inflated and it drifted down toward the Gulf of Mexico, slowing its speed to just 24 km per hour, before dropping into the sea. 

Comprising the crew were two NASA astronauts, mission commander Shane Kimbrough and pilot Megan McArthur, as well as Japanese astronaut Akihiko Hoshide and mission specialist Thomas Pesquet, a French engineer from the European Space Agency.

It was the third crew launched into orbit under NASA’s fledgling partnership with SpaceX, the rocket company formed in 2002 by billionaire Elon Musk.

What she thought at first was been a cat turned out, in fact, to be a bear.

""It was just so surreal. I'm not an outdoorsy kind of girl, never been around any bears,"" she said.

Zsa7DUnqsUI,hd,"Nearly two years since the U.S.-Canada border was closed because of the COVID-19 pandemic, the United States is preparing to reopen its land border to fully-vaccinated Canadian travellers. Ross Lord takes a look at the relief, the reluctance, and the red tape that remains on the eve of the reopening.

Meanwhile in the U.S., more disturbing details are emerging from rapper Travis Scott's Astroworld music festival, which is now considered one of the deadliest concert tragedies in that country. Eight people died after the crowd surged toward the stage during Scott's performance, including two victims aged 14 and 16 years old. Jennifer Johnson has the latest details on what may have triggered the panic.

In Iraq, security forces in Baghdad are on high alert after Prime Minister Mustafa Al-Kadhimi survived an assassination attempt at his own home. The attack involved the use of explosive-laden drones swooping into his house. Mike Drolet looks at the country's political upheavals that may have led to the attack.

According to a report published in 2018, Canada's health-care sector accounts for just under five per cent of the country's emissions. It's an amount that's not ""massive,"" but still significant, according to Fiona Miller, a professor of health policy and director of the Centre for Sustainable Health Systems at the University of Toronto. So how could Canada's health-care system become greener? Jamie Mauracher has more.

Although multi-billionaires like Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos are seeing their fortunes rapidly expand, the ultra wealthy are often taxed in the United States at lower rates than the average person. As Jackson Proskow reports, the idea of a special wealth tax is now gaining momentum, and it's aimed at the country's richest people.

Back in Canada, the Indigenous population in Toronto continues to face disturbingly low levels of COVID-19 vaccinations. Almost half of that group over the age of 15 have not been fully-vaccinated. Kayla McLean looks into why.

And with Remembrance Day fast approaching, it now has special significance for one Winnipeg family, thanks to some diligent detective work in Calgary. As Gil Tucker shows us, it all starts with a chance discovery in the back of a thrift store.

Ottawa's pandemic benefits were meant to help Canadians, particularly seniors and other vulnerable people. 

Low-income Canadian seniors in particular were also already relying on other financial aid programs. Yet, tens of thousands of seniors have had their Guaranteed Income Supplement cut off or reduced because the pandemic benefits they received in 2020 had pushed them temporarily into a higher income bracket. David Akin explains how money that's meant to help them through the pandemic has now stripped them of any help at all.

Backlash is mounting in Quebec and Ontario, where COVID-19 vaccine mandates for health-care workers have been ditched. The provinces believe the rules could result in staff shortages. But would health-care systems really be at risk? Eric Sorensen has a reality check.

Ross Lord explains why the crisis for the province's patients is not over yet and why the rest of the country should pay attention.

After undergoing a biopsy, British Columbia Premier John Horgan has confirmed the growth in his throat is cancerous. Keith Baldrey looks at the treatment ahead for Horgan and the critical message the 62-year-old is sending to the general public.

And Ottawa's pandemic benefits were meant to help Canadians, particularly seniors and other vulnerable people. But as David Akin explains, that much-needed money has now dried up for some of the population.

a0f83YA844o,hd,"The United States finally reopened its land border to non-essential travel on Monday for the first time in nearly two years. As Mike Le Couteur reports, pressure is growing on Ottawa to scrap its requirement for anyone entering Canada to present a negative PCR COVID-19 test.

Meanwhile, as MPs get back to work on Parliament Hill, there's talk of a potential deal between the Liberals and the NDP, so Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's minority government can stay in power. David Akin explains how Conservative Leader Erin O'Toole is slamming the idea and how O'Toole is facing criticism as well.

Also, with the deadline to join a class-action lawsuit against the Canadian Armed Forces over sexual misconduct fast approaching, the number of claimants is ballooning. As Abigail Bimman reports, people are still being urged to step forward.

Plus, the second and final week of the COP26 climate summit is underway in Glasgow, Scotland, where world leaders are hashing out the finer details of how new commitments will be met. But as Redmond Shannon reports, poorer countries are calling for more action on sharing the burden, as richer nations are blamed for the most emissions.

The supply chain shortage is frustrating customers and merchants around the world, with everything from cars to toys low in stock. So why are climate researchers glad to see the problem in the spotlight? Eric Sorensen explains why harmful emissions can start with our shopping habits.

And during the First World War, hundreds of Black Canadians eagerly signed up for duty. But the military rejected them because they weren't white, so they went on to form the only all-Black battalion in the history of the Canadian Armed Forces. Ross Lord explains this unit's critical role in the war and the long overdue apology coming from Ottawa.

In midtown Manhattan is the Dreamverse NFT (Non-Fungible Token) Festival, featuring the work of more than 150 NFT artists, as curated by 10 NFT artists, TIME and crypto-exclusive fund, Metapurse.

Among the artists who are having their work featured include Jose N. Silva, who credits the pandemic for the rise of digital art and the rise of the NFT community.

""Everyone was at home... we didn't have a lot of in-person interaction... I think that's kind of like what catapulted this whole idea of the Metaverse, because a lot of people were meeting up, you know, daily on online forums,"" he said. ""For all of that to culminate into an in-person thing where people can actually see the art... is a big moment in the space.""

But employers in many industries say the labour market remains difficult, with finding new employees still difficult resulting in some having to cut back hours at a time when revenue remains desperately needed.

As Anne Gaviola explains, the issue appears to be revolving around the issue of ""ghosting,"" in which job candidates are not showing up for interviews and in some cases, not even showing up for the job they were hired to do.

teI6ZVXfVPQ,hd,"The funeral for former U.S. Secretary of State Gen. Colin Powell was held Friday afternoon at the Washington National Cathedral.

President Joe Biden and first lady Jill Biden attended along with former presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama. Former secretary of states Hillary Clinton and Madeleine Albright also attended.

Powell’s family said the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff died due to complications from COVID-19.

Powell, who was the first Black secretary of state, was a mainstay in American politics for decades, and was named to senior posts by three Republican presidents and reached the top of the U.S. military during his career.

Powell served as U.S. national security adviser under then-president Ronald Reagan from 1987 to 1989. A four-star general, he chaired the Joint Chiefs of Staff under then-president George H.W. Bush during the 1991 Gulf War that saw U.S.-led forces expel Iraqi troops from neighbouring Kuwait.

A moderate Republican, Powell did consider a bid to become the first Black president in 1996, but his wife Alma’s worries about his safety steered him away. In 2008, he broke with his party to endorse Democrat Barack Obama, who became the first Black president in U.S. history.

Grosskreutz said at one point, he had drawn his Glock pistol but did not intend to use it, however at that time he told prosecutors he thought he ""was going to die.""

The testimony from Grosskreutz was seen as the only chance for lawyers from both sides to question a survivor from that night and get testimony on his mindset and actions, which could be crucial to determining whether Rittenhouse had reason to fear for his life, as he has maintained.

From how materials are shipped, all the way to how products are manufactured and used, every link in the supply chains expands the carbon footprint and affects the climate. Eric Sorensen explains why harmful emissions can start with our shopping habits.

Spokespersons for the alliance signed an agreement in Washington, D.C. on Friday, piling pressure on Ahmed as rebel forces advance toward the capital of Addis Ababa.

The alliance includes political, military and diplomatic cooperation and expands an existing agreement between the forces from the northern region of Tigray and the Oromo Liberation Army (OLA), one of the organizers told Reuters. 

The conflict in Ethiopia’s north started a year ago when forces loyal to the Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF) seized military bases in Tigray. In response, Ahmed sent troops to the northern region.

Plante took an early lead straight out of the gate. By 9:30 p.m., her lead over main competitor, Ensemble Montréal’s Denis Coderre, had surpassed 11,000 votes — good enough for Global News to project her the winner.
 
Plante declared herself the night’s winner in a tweet around the same time, in which she thanked Montrealers.

She wasted no time making history again — also announcing that Dominique Ollivier would be the city’s executive committee chair, marking the first time two women lead the city.

Some of Plante’s campaign priorities included adding more social housing, fighting climate change and improving public security.

ttnFVI1fsDE,hd,"Speaking to reporters on Monday after the U.S. House passed President Joe Biden’s signature $1-trillion infrastructure bill over the weekend, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said the bill “sells itself,” adding that communities “never needed to be persuaded” to upgrade local infrastructure.

Buttigieg said his department has been “gearing up hoping this bill would pass” and said while some infrastructure projects could be implemented on a short timeframe, in other cases the administration would have to “stand up” entirely new projects to be implemented on a longer timeframe. 

Buttigieg also explained how changes spurred by the new bill would help the government ease supply chain issues, especially at U.S. ports.

Health Minister Adrian Dix said this number includes 1,032 casual staff, 989 full-time staff, 819 part-time staff and 16 people whose job status is unknown.

Breaking it down further, Dix said 28 are in emergency medicine, 105 in general medicine, 246 care aides and community assistants, 19 from internal medicine, 906 nurses, 86 paramedics and 10 resident doctors.

Meanwhile, B.C. is expecting a shipment of Johnson & Johnson vaccine soon, provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry said.

Unvaccinated health workers will be offered this one-dose vaccine first, Henry said, because it might be a better option for people who are more vaccine-hesitant but want to keep working.

F38VvfRHOi0,hd,"Children under 12 are now leading the country in new COVID-19 infections as they await approval for vaccination, Canada’s chief medical officer of health Dr. Theresa Tam said during a Friday news conference.

In new national data released Friday, Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) officials said that during the fourth wave, infections in that age group surpassed those of all other age groups for the first time in the pandemic.

The trend comes as vaccination increases in older age groups, while children under 12 await approval for a jab.

Officials added that the majority of cases among children do not involve severe illness. In fact, fewer than one per cent of children and youth up to 19 years of age with COVID-19 have been severely sick. To date, more than 350,000 cases have been reported in that age range.

9nFmG1MDQeo,hd,"HOUSTON — At least eight people were killed and dozens injured in a crowd crush at a Travis Scott concert at the Astroworld Festival in Houston, according to CNN.

The incident occured on Friday night, November 5, and witnesses said people began being compressed against one another when a countdown timer appeared 30 minutes before Scott began to perform.

With around 50,000 people in the crowd, the pressure got worse and worse as the timer counted down, according to one witness who was eventually crowd-surfed to safety having passed out. 

According to CNN, several witnesses noted a lack of medical personnel at the site as many people lost consciousness and some members of the crowd attempted to perform CPR themselves.

While questions remain over why the show was not immediately stopped, witnesses cited by CNN say that for his part Travis Scott did pause the show several times.

Meanwhile, crowd safety expert Paul Wertheimer described how crushes like these occur when people in a crowd are forced to compete against each other for the best location or best area to be. “The crowd was allowed to get too dense and was not managed properly,” he said, according to The Los Angeles Times. “The fans were the victims of an environment in which they could not control.”

qqOL9M9xVPU,hd,"The success of the new Dune movie has people speculating about whether humans changing Mars’s surface and atmosphere to be more like Earth’s, known as terraforming, is possible and, according to the BBC, the primary issue is creating a breathable atmosphere to match Earth’s, where currently plants and bacteria give out oxygen through photosynthesis.

For Earth, large-scale oxygenation initially occurred 2.3 billion years ago, when bacteria began releasing oxygen as waste, according to the Nature Communications journal, but the BBC explains the difficulty in artificially introducing bacteria to do the same on Mars is that water which could be used for photosynthesis is currently frozen.

One solution to that problem could be building automated factories on Mars that produce greenhouse gases which warm up the planet and melt the ice.”

However, any additional atmosphere that was generated would still have to deal with an additional problem called ‘spallation,’ where high energy radiation from the sun blasts away a planet’s atmosphere, a process which already afflicted Mars 3.5 billion years ago.

One researcher who spoke to the BBC suggested that once an active biosphere is established on Mars, oxygen production may be able to match losses from spallation.

But in 2017 NASA scientists at NASA’s Planetary Science Vision 2050 Workshop suggested creating an artificial magnetic field that sits in front of the planet in order to protect it from the sun’s radiation.

The idea is that a structure that generates a magnetic dipole field at the Mars L1 Lagrange Point could allow the Martian atmosphere to become thick enough to melt ice at Mars’ northern pole and, in time, spark a greenhouse gas effect that could restore some of Mars’ oceans.

n1NNC_p4pQ8,hd,"WINTERVILLE, GEORGIA — People in northern Georgia are freaking out because their yards are being taken over by huge alien spiders that are covering everything in thick clouds of spider web. Here are the details:

The Guardian reports that northern Georgia is suffering from an infestation of giant invasive spiders called Joro spiders. 

Going by the scientific name Trichonephila clavata, these spiders are having a very visible effect on the people of the region, as they spin dense clouds of spiderweb that can be as deep as 3 meters. 

The invasive species was first spotted in Georgia in 2014, but this year their numbers have exploded and people are finding their yards covered in dense clouds of spiderweb. 

It doesn’t help that these large and spooky webs also contain multiple large spiders that, when fully grown, can each easily cover a large man’s hand. Joro spiders are common in Japan, China, Korea and Taiwan. 

It is unclear how they made their way to the U.S. Researchers say the particular abundance of the spiders this year could have been caused by changes in weather. 

Will Hudson, an entomologist at the University of Georgia, said that he had killed more than 300 of the spiders, as they made his porch unusable by covering it with clouds of spider web.

“The webs are a real mess,” Hudson said. “Nobody wants to come out of the door in the morning, walk down the steps and get a face full of spiderweb.”

8Whitkkw5JA,hd,"LEEDS, U.K. — Scientists published a new study in the journal Nature Communications, in which they show that Greenland’s ice sheet is melting at such a fast pace that it’s heightening worldwide flood risks. 

The study, which was published on Monday, November 1, found that the Greenland ice sheet has lost more than 3.5 trillion tons of ice over the past decade, which increased global sea levels by one centimeter. 

This one ice sheet contains enough ice to raise global sea levels by 6 meters, or 20 feet, and it has been experiencing an increasing number of extreme melting events over the past 40 years. 

The new research is the first to use satellite data to detect Greenland ice sheet runoff.

The satellite images showed significant annual variation in ice melt and showed that heat waves were increasingly a major cause of ice loss — above and beyond global temperature increases. 

In 2012 alone, for example, when changes in atmospheric patterns caused unusually warm air to hover over the ice sheet for weeks, 527 billion tonnes of ice was lost.

Lead author of the study, Thomas Slater of the University of Leeds, said: “As our climate warms, it’s reasonable to expect that the instances of extreme melting in Greenland will happen more often.”

GUQa2CW5shw,hd,"YUMEN, CHINA — The scale and speed of construction at possible missile silo fields in China suggests its government is putting significant resources into developing its nuclear capabilities, with a new Federation of American Scientists report increasing an estimate of the total number of new silos being built from the 229 described in a previous report to 300.

The new report is careful to state that it is not certain what is in the silos, but says there is “increased confidence” that they are related to the People’s Liberation Army Rocket Force’s modernization program and, based on commercially available satellite images, it describes significant progress on construction since the earlier report in July. 

It also describes how China appears to be experimenting with different types of shelters at the three silo field sites near Yumen, Hami and Ordos in north-central China, before concluding that although China is currently still far behind the U.S. and Russia’s total nuclear arsenal, the new silos could see China’s total intercontinental ballistic missile force exceed that of either Russia and the United States in the foreseeable future.

PtSSoZW19vs,hd,"For decades, Intel was the leading maker of the world’s most advanced chips. Intel’s history is interwoven with that of Silicon Valley, credited with the invention of RAM and microprocessors, the building blocks of modern computing. Now Intel has fallen behind. But its new CEO, Pat Gelsinger, has a bold plan to catch up to Samsung and TSMC by 2025, by building new chip fabrication plants in the U.S., Europe and Israel totaling more than $44 billion. CNBC got an exclusive tour at the fab expansion outside Portland, Oregon, that’s set to open early next year.

The world’s smallest and most-efficient chips are usually referred to as 5 nanometer, a nomenclature that once referred to the width of transistors on the chip. They power cutting-edge data processing and the latest generation of Apple iPhones. TSMC and Samsung make all of these 5-nanometer chips at fabs in Asia. 

“They took their eye off the ball,” said Stacy Rasgon, an analyst at Bernstein. “Once you fall off the treadmill, it’s really really difficult to get back on. It’s a very dynamic and fast-moving industry.”

In 1990, 37% of the world’s semiconductors were made in the U.S., according to industry association Semi. Last year, U.S. market share was down to 12%, according to the association. The government is hoping to change that with the CHIPS Act, which includes a proposed $52 billion in subsidies for chip companies like Intel that commit to manufacturing in the U.S. 

“It also starts building up that base within the United States, so that the United States can become more self-sufficient,” said Ann Kelleher, Intel’s senior vice president of technology development .

TSMC is responsible for 92% of the world’s 5-nanometer chips, according to research group Capital Economics. This leaves the global chip supply vulnerable to natural disasters like earthquakes and the region’s current drought. There’s also the escalating geopolitical tension between China and Taiwan, as well as the U.S.-China trade war.

“Every aspect of defense, intelligence, government operations is becoming more digital,” Gelsinger said. “And we want to rely on foreign technology for those critical aspects of our defense and national security? I don’t think so.”

The next steps in Intel’s playbook include a chip so efficient that the company didn’t measure it in nanometers but with an even smaller unit of measurement called the angstrom. Intel said the 18a, which is in development for 2025, will accelerate the company past its competitors.

“We will be the world’s largest integrated design and manufacturer of silicon for the long term,” Gelsinger said.

“It’s a tall order and it is not my expectation that he will hit that,” Susquehanna’s Rolland said. “But if he could hit that timetable, it would put them back, in my opinion, on par with TSM head to head.”

YQvILwnQef0,hd,"For years, Exxon Mobil was one of the largest publicly-traded companies in the United States. Coming climate legislation may target the core of the oil and gas giant's operation: production and exploration. The company says it will pivot. But the plan relies on capturing carbon from the oil it will keep pumping in the future. Watch the video to see what experts think of Exxon's green economy plans.

Oil giant Exxon Mobil, once the most valuable company in the U.S., is fighting for its future.

Over the summer, investors forced a change on Exxon’s board. Since then, the company has been speeding up plans for its green economy pivot, which includes carbon capture and storage.

Carbon capture is the process of capturing CO2 at its source. Companies can store the carbon dioxide permanently, but it is more profitable and common to use the captured carbon in further fossil fuel production.

Congressional researchers say U.S. companies have pioneered the technology worldwide, injecting roughly 68 million metric tons of carbon dioxide back into the ground every year.

Exxon Mobil recently announced a plan to increase the amount of carbon it captures from its refineries near Houston, Texas. The company says it has captured 40% of the world’s captured carbon to date. 

But another count from the investors at Engine No. 1 suggests that Exxon may be capturing less than 1% of its own annual emissions on a rolling basis. This count includes Scope 3 emissions, a much broader accounting of a company’s planet warming potential. Exxon Mobil publicly disclosed an estimate of its Scope 3 emissions for the first time in 2021.

The company told CNBC it will try to flatten its production of fossil fuels through 2025, depending on market conditions. More changes could come as regulators around the world zero in on climate.

But carbon market scholar Kate Ervine said that “the devil is in the details” when it comes to writing climate policies that affect oil and gas majors.

BiQizeJ7wI0,hd,"As the amount of student debt in the U.S. climbs to over $1.7 trillion, students each year are plunged into debilitating debt. President Biden campaigned on a promise of cancelling $10,000 in student debt for every single borrower, but so far his administration hasn’t moved to do so. Economists and activists say, even if he does cancel a portion of student debt, more must be done to prevent student loans from ballooning again in the future.

Student debt in the U.S. has ballooned to over $1.7 trillion since Congress first allowed college students to borrow from the government in 1958. This debt has varying effects on students, workers and the larger economy.

“We see the student debt crisis when it comes to individual student loan borrowers. We see how student loan borrowers struggle to save for retirement, to have emergency savings, to buy houses, to start small businesses,” Student Borrower Protection Center former executive director Seth Frotman told CNBC.

In the last few years, though, activists from both sides of the aisle have called for the president to do something about student debt. Many have even pushed for outright cancellation.

“It is abundantly clear that under a statute called the Higher Education Act, the president of the United States has the legal authority to cancel federally owned student debt,” said Rep. Mondaire Jones, D- N.Y.

Some argue that debt cancelation isn’t the answer and would mostly benefit wealthier borrowers who don’t have a problem paying off their loans on time.

“If I were to say to you, would you borrow one hundred thousand dollars to go to Harvard Law School, you wouldn’t blink and say yes, that’s clearly a good deal,” Wellesley College economics professor Phil Levine said. “We shouldn’t be absolving those people off their debt. They made an enormous investment that’s going to pay off, really, a lot.”

President Joe Biden has been largely silent about a plan to broadly cancel student debt since taking office, even though he campaigned on canceling up to $10,000 in student debt for all borrowers. However, his administration has absolved some student debt for certain groups like borrowers with disabilities and active duty service members.

The 10 New Insights in Climate Science:

1. Stabilizing at 1.5°C warming is still possible, but immediate and drastic global action is required
2. Rapid growth in methane and nitrous oxide emissions put us on track for 2.7°C warming
3. Megafires – climate change forces fire extremes to reach new dimensions with extreme impacts
4. Climate tipping elements incur high-impact risks
5. Global climate action must be just
6. Supporting household behaviour changes is a crucial but often overlooked opportunity for climate action
7. Political challenges impede the effectiveness of carbon pricing
8. Nature-based solutions are critical for the pathway to Paris – but look at the fine print
9. Building resilience of marine ecosystems is achievable by climate-adapted conservation and management, and global stewardship
10. Costs of climate change mitigation can be justified by the multiple immediate benefits to the health of humans and nature

---------

The UN Climate Change Conference (COP 26) in Glasgow, United Kingdom is a crucial opportunity to achieve pivotal, transformational change in global climate policy and action. It is a credibility test for global efforts to address climate change and it is where Parties must make considerable progress to reach consensus on issues they have been discussing for several years. COP 26 comes against the background of widespread, rapid and intensifying climate change impacts, which are already impacting every region on Earth. Also, COP 26 comes against the background of the COVID-19 pandemic, with the urgent need to build back better for present future generations to ensure a safe future.

The UNFCCC secretariat (UN Climate Change) is the United Nations entity tasked with supporting the global response to the threat of climate change. UNFCCC stands for United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. The Convention has near universal membership (197 Parties) and is the parent treaty of the 2015 Paris Agreement. The main aim of the Paris Agreement is to keep the global average temperature rise this century as close as possible to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. The UNFCCC is also the parent treaty of the 1997 Kyoto Protocol. The ultimate objective of all three agreements under the UNFCCC is to stabilize greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that will prevent dangerous human interference with the climate system, in a time frame which allows ecosystems to adapt naturally and enables sustainable development.",PT8M12S,none,2021-11-05T03:00:23Z,"UN, United Nations",10 New Insights in Climate Science | #COP26  | Climate action

f0EpnIAbUGE,hd,"“The facts show a widespread and systematic attacks on a civilian population, amounting to crimes against humanity,” committed by the Myanmar security forces following the February coup, the Head of the Independent Investigative Mechanism for Myanmar Nichols Koumjian said on Friday.

“We received so many communications, particularly from people inside Myanmar, urging us to accomplish some type of accountability, asking us to bring people to account and end the violence that's happening there,” Koumjian said.

His team has so far received over 200,000 communications since the coup and collected over one and a half million items of evidence.

“We will continue to collect that evidence and to analyze it in order to fulfill our mandate, so that one day those most responsible for the serious international crimes in Myanmar will be brought to account,” Koumjian said, explaining that in the first month or so, security forces applied “measured response” towards demonstrations against the coup.

“However, we then saw an uptick in violence and much more violent methods used to suppress the demonstrators. And this was happening in different places at the same time, indicating to us it would be logical to conclude this was from a central policy. And also we saw that particular groups were targeted, especially for arrests and detentions that appeared to be without due process of law. And this includes, of course, the journalists, medical workers, and political opponents,” Koumjian said.

""(...)
I need to tell you what is happening in my home country. Right now as we sit comfortably here in this conference center in Glasgow, over 2 million of my fellow Kenyans are facing climate-related starvation. In this past year, both of our rainy seasons have failed, and scientists say that it may be another 12 months before the waters return again. Meanwhile, our rivers are running dry. Our harvests are failing. Our storehouses stand empty. Our animals and people are dying. I have seen with my own eyes three young children crying at the side of a dried-up river, after walking 12 miles with their mother to find water.

Please open your hearts. This is not only happening in Kenya. Over the past few months, there have been deadly heat waves and wildfires in Algeria and devastating floods in Uganda and Nigeria. And there is more still to come. By 2025, in just four years’ time, half of the world’s population will be facing water scarcity. And by the time I’m 50, the climate crisis will have displaced 86 million people in sub-Saharan Africa alone. …

Please open your hearts. If you allow yourself to feel it, the heartbreak and the injustice is hard to bear. Sub-Saharan Africans are responsible for just half a percent of historical emissions. The children are responsible for none. But they are bearing the brunt. We are the adults on this Earth right now, and it is our responsibility to ensure that the children have food and water.

I have been doing what I can. Inspired by the great professor Wangari Maathai, I founded the Green Generation Initiative, a tree-growing initiative that enhances food security for young Kenyans. So far we have grown 30,000 fruit trees to maturity, providing desperately needed nutrition for thousands of children. Every day we see that when we look after the trees, they look after us. But these trees and the life-saving fruit they bear will not survive on a 2.7 degrees Celsius warmer planet.

The decisions you make here will help determine whether the rains will return to our land. The decisions you make here will help determine whether the fruit trees we plant will live or perish. The decisions you make here will help determine whether children will have food and water.

I believe in our human capacity to care deeply and to act collectively. I believe in our ability to do what is right, if we let ourselves feel it in our hearts. So, for these next two weeks, let us feel it in our hearts. The children cannot live on words and empty promises. They are waiting for you to act. Please open your hearts, and then act. Thank you"".

-GT7qqVlLA8,hd,"20 years after the adoption of Security Council resolution 1373, the Executive Director of the Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC) Michèle Coninsx today (4 Nov) said the resolution “remains as relevant as it was on the day of its adoption” as “the terrorist threat persists” and has “sought to survive and evolve.”

On 28 September 2001, the Security Council adopted resolution 1373 a landmark resolution that defined a broad counter-terrorism mandate for the international community and established the CTC to monitor Member States’ implementation of its provisions.

Coninsx said, “trends have evolved, and one of those trends – indeed – that we see more and more, the use of new technologies for terrorist purposes” and noted that “we, 20 years ago, didn’t have our cell phones and have a connection to social media, and now it’s an integral part of our lives.” She added that “because of COVID-19, we are even more driven to our home offices and more reliable on the online possibilities.”

The CTC Executive Director said, “ISIL / Al Qaeda affiliated groups are expanding and are becoming a real threat” that “needs to be contained.”

She said, “the only way in doing so is to join forces to make sure that we target and focus our forces in relation to the identified gaps, fragilities, and risks, and that we make sure that technical assistance and capacity building is sent to those spots in a minimum of time.”

Since 2001, the United Nations has been at the heart of the global effort to combat terrorism in all its forms and manifestations. The Council has taken the leading role in guiding the evolution of the approaches required to address the threat of terrorism. Security Council resolution 1373 (2001) is the foundation upon which the Council’s active counter-terrorism framework is built and continues to provide the basis for further developments in countering terrorism.

A special meeting at UN Headquarters will adopt a forward-looking stance by considering next steps for the Committee and CTED, as well as the future of counter-terrorism efforts. This will enable Member States, United Nations bodies, international and regional organizations and entities, civil society groups and academia to discuss areas where further engagement and innovation are required, especially with regard to addressing emerging terrorist threats and ways in which the United Nations counter-terrorism efforts and architecture could be further enhanced to help strengthen States’ responses to the global terrorist threat, in compliance with international law, including international human rights, refugee, and humanitarian law.",PT41M43S,none,2021-11-05T12:00:01Z,"UN, United Nations, Counter-Terrorism Committee, counter-terrorism, Resolution 1373",Counter-Terrorism: 20th anniversary of Committee establishment  - Press Conference (4 Nov 2021)

OBI5xX79uNk,hd,"Briefing by Rosemary DiCarlo, Under-Secretary-General for Political and Peacebuilding Affairs, on the situation in Ethiopia.

UN political chief Rosemary DiCarlo said the risk of Ethiopia “descending into widening civil war is only too real” adding that the political repercussions of “intensifying violence in the wider region would be immense, compounding the many crises besetting the Horn of Africa.”.

Addressing the Security Council today (08 Nov), the UN Under-Secretary-General for Political and Peacebuilding Affairs said, despite much speculation on how the Ethiopian crisis will unfold in the coming weeks, “In a country of over 110 million people, over 90 different ethnic groups and 80 languages, no one can predict what continued fighting and insecurity will bring.”

DiCarlo said more than seven million people need humanitarian assistance in northern Ethiopia alone, with an estimated 400,000 people in Tigray living in famine-like conditions. She said, while some emergency supplies have been moved, it has been four months since the last major shipment of medicines and health supplies into Tigray.

The UN official said the report of the joint OHCHR-Ethiopian Human Rights Commission investigation into the conflict in Tigray released last week shed light on the horrific suffering civilians have endured. The report concluded that there are reasonable grounds to believe that all parties to the conflict - including the Ethiopian National Defence Force, Eritrean Defence Force, Amhara Special Forces and allied militia on one side and Tigrayan forces on the other - committed violations of international human rights, humanitarian and refugee law. It also stated that war crimes and crimes against humanity may have been also committed.

DiCarlo said there must be an immediate cessation of hostilities, as called for by the UN Secretary-General, African Union Commission Chair, IGAD Executive Secretary, Kenyan President Ururu Kenyatta, and the UN Security Council.

She said, “Ethiopia, a founding member of the United Nations, needs our support. We urge Ethiopians to come together to build a shared, prosperous future before it is too late.”",PT8M31S,none,2021-11-09T04:00:09Z,"UN, United Nations, ethiopia",“The risk of Ethiopia descending into a widening civil war is too real” – Security Council Briefing

COP26 
Today is Youth Day at COP26 in Glasgow. The Secretary-General’s Youth Advisory Group hosted an event bringing together young climate activists, with a focus on working for the inclusion of young people in formal decision-making processes. The event also heard from indigenous youth leaders on the importance of traditional knowledge as a vital component of climate action.  The Secretary-General’s Special Adviser on Climate Action, Selwin Hart, addressed the meeting, and urged young people to continue raising their voices, and maintaining hope that the climate crisis can be overcome. He thanked the Youth Advisory Group for their service, and for their valuable insights and advice to the Secretary-General. 
Youth protests outside the COP26 venue were heard inside the COP as the Conference marked Youth and Empowerment Day. Youth leaders presented Global Youth Position statement, representing the views of over 40,000 young climate leaders from across the world to COP leaders.  The Executive Secretary of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, Patricia Espinosa, said she would take the demands, which she said were reasonable and justified, to the parties. 
Negotiations proceeded on texts to finalize the Paris Agreement rulebook.  COP President Alok Sharma asked negotiators to clear as many items as possible by next week, in advance of the high-level ministerial segment. This includes negotiations on Article Six, which covers trade, and which the COP President noted has eluded agreement now for six years. 

ETHIOPIA 
The Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs, Martin Griffiths, started his mission to Ethiopia today. He met with Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed and the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs, Demeke Mekonnen. 
Mr. Griffiths had constructive discussions on the humanitarian situation in the country and the challenges that aid organizations face in getting assistance to all Ethiopians in need. 
Tomorrow, he is scheduled to meet with representatives of non-governmental organizations, UN agencies and the diplomatic community to discuss efforts to provide relief assistance to the millions of people in need. 
Conflict, drought, flooding, disease outbreaks and desert locust infestation continue to drive humanitarian needs across Ethiopia. Some 20 million people are targeted for humanitarian assistance, including 7 million who are directly affected by the conflict in northern Ethiopia. 
The funding gap for the humanitarian response in Ethiopia for 2021 stands at more than $1.3 billion. An estimated $606 million has been mobilized for response towards the Northern Ethiopia Response Plan, and $474 million for response towards the draft Humanitarian Response Plan, which covers areas outside Tigray. However, this is far from sufficient to cover the mounting humanitarian needs. 
Also from Ethiopia, the World Food Programme, the UN Refugee Agency, and Ethiopia’s national agency for Refugee and Returnee Affairs today jointly appealed for $68 million to avoid cuts in food rations for more than 700,000 refugees.  
The agencies warned of increased malnutrition and anaemia and stunted child growth, among other risks. 

AFGHANISTAN 
Nearly 23 million people – or 55 per cent of the Afghan population – are estimated to be in crisis or experiencing emergency levels of food insecurity between November 2021 and March 2022. 
Our colleagues tell us that reports of isolated clashes and violence affecting civilians and resulting in casualties continued countrywide this week. In Jalalabad, in Nangarhar Province, gunfire directed at de facto authorities resulted in the deaths of two children on the 1st of November; and a roadside radio-controlled improvised explosive device detonation reportedly targeting the de facto authorities killed two civilians on the 3rd of November. Yesterday, armed clashed were reported in Bamyan Province, resulting in the injury of five people, including one civilian.  
For its part, on the 3rd of November, the Food and Agriculture Organization began the autumn season wheat seed and fertilizer distribution campaign in the east of the country. Technical training sessions on agricultural best practices are planned, and FAO expects to reach nearly 140,000 people in the provinces of Nangarhar, Kunar, Laghman and Nuristan. 
The Afghanistan Flash Appeal, which targets 11 million people with aid until the end of the year, seeks $606 million and is currently 54 per cent funded.

SECURITY COUNCIL 
Speaking to a high-level meeting of the Security Council on exclusion, inequality and conflicts, the Secretary-General first reminded all Council members that for the poorest and most vulnerable people, the COVID-19 pandemic has amplified misery and inequalities.    
Exclusion and inequalities of all kinds, he added, come with a devastating toll to security.     
The Secretary-General said that as we face the highest number of violent conflicts since 1945, a dangerous sense of impunity is taking hold —seen in the recent seizures of power by force, including military coups.    
Peace has never been more urgent, Mr. Guterres said, but humanitarian funding, assistance and conflict management tools — the very kind that the UN provides around the world — are all under tremendous strain.     
In his remarks, he also outlined a roadmap to promote inclusion, built around four key pathways: people, prevention, gender and institutions.   
In every society, diversity of culture, religion and ethnicity should be viewed as a powerful benefit, rather than a threat. Without full inclusion and equality, he concluded, peace is a job half done.
Also today, the Secretary-General met with H.E. Mr. Andrés Manuel López Obrador, President of Mexico.  The Secretary-General thanked Mexico for its support to the work of the Organization, including as an elected member of the Security Council.  
The Secretary-General and the President discussed the impact of economic inequality and corruption on development and peace, as well as efforts to address climate change and the global economic recovery from COVID-19.

ETHIOPIA 
On Ethiopia, the Emergency Relief Coordinator, Martin Griffiths, wrapped up a four-day visit to the country yesterday. He met with Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed and the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs, Demeke Mekonnen.  
Mr. Griffiths also met with the African Union’s High Representative for the Horn of Africa, former President Olusegun Obasanjo. Mr. Griffiths also held talks with representatives of non-governmental organizations, UN agencies, donors and Member States. 
The Emergency Relief Coordinator also made a one-day visit to Mekelle, in Tigray.
While in Ethiopia, Mr. Griffiths addressed challenges related to the suspension of the UN Humanitarian Air Service flights; the availability of fuel, cash and supplies; the bureaucratic impediments, including visas for humanitarian staff; and the treatment of humanitarian personnel. 
He stressed that we, along with its partners, will continue to work with the Government of Ethiopia and with local and international partners to support millions of people in need of urgent humanitarian assistance across the country. 
The funding gap for the humanitarian response plan for Ethiopia in 2021 stands at more than $1.3 billion.  
Yesterday, the Under-Secretary-General for Political and Peacebuilding Affairs, Rosemary DiCarlo, told the Security Council in the afternoon that there must be an immediate cessation of hostilities in Ethiopia. 
In response to questions about detained UN staff in Ethiopia, I can tell you that the current numbers are that 16 national staff have been detained, while 6 have been released.  We are actively working with the government to secure their immediate release.

VENEZUELA
Today, a three-member Panel of Electoral Experts began deploying in Venezuela. The Panel will undertake an independent technical assessment of the electoral system in the context of the 21 November regional and municipal elections, which will take place in Venezuela. The Panel will remain in the country until shortly after polling day. Panel members will meet with a wide range of political and civil society actors, as well as electoral authorities and experts. 
This type of electoral assistance has been provided by the UN in the past to other countries upon their request. Unlike UN electoral observation missions, which require a specific mandate by the Security Council or the General Assembly, the Panels of Electoral Experts do not issue evaluative public statements on the overall conduct of the electoral process or their results.  
The Panel will however provide an internal report to the Secretary-General with recommendations to strengthen future election processes. At the discretion of the Secretary-General, recommendations formulated by the Panel may be transmitted back to national authorities. 
The members of the Panel of Experts all have extensive electoral experience working for the United Nations in other contexts.

E6GDT-7o6DA,hd,"World leaders and environmental experts have welcomed a UN climate deal that for the first time targets fossil fuel as the key driver of global warming.  However many expressed disappointment with the agreement and warned that the world was still on course for disastrous warming. 

The summit reached deadlock over coal power after India and China blocked a call for it to be completely phased out.  Instead the summit could only agree that it would be “phased down”.

The UK, which hosted the summit, hailed the deal as a “game-changing agreement”.   But critics warned that it does not deliver  the key summit goal of limiting global warming to 1.5C by the end of the century.

The summit did agree to provide money for poorer countries to help them adapt to climate change, as well as curbs to methane emissions and deforestation.

It comes after India was accused of watering down a COP26 climate deal to cut coal consumption.

Air quality in the city has been hovering between ""severe"" and ""hazardous"" for several days.

Burning of crop stubble, industrial and vehicular pollution, and weather patterns turn the city's air noxious every winter.

But the air in the capital and other areas remains poor most of the year. Pollutants from coal-fired power plants are among the culprits.

Despite pressure on India and China, two of the world's top carbon emitters, to sign a deal to end coal use, the two big consumers of coal proposed a last-minute change in wording - countries have now agreed to ""phase down"" rather than ""phase out"" coal.

The 85-year-old had been diagnosed with cancer earlier this year.

He came to power in 1989 under apartheid, a system of legalised racism, but later became a key figure in the transition to democracy.

He ordered Nelson Mandela's release from prison, leading to a historic transition of power and elections in which  the anti-apartheid leader became South Africa’s first black president.

De Klerk shared the Nobel Peace Prize with Mandela for helping to negotiate an end to apartheid. But his legacy divides opinion in South Africa.

They spend hours on the temple premises, hustling the crowd, jostling with each other, hoping to make a little more money than they did the previous day.

But in the words of one photographer, ""it's a digital world now"" - no-one has the time or inclination to pose and pay for a photograph that needs to be printed. All they want, he said, is a display image for Facebook or Instagram.

_kJkbJoZA-A,hd,"The story of Aisha and her sons could be anyone’s story. The matriarch, recently widowed, tries to bring her fractured family together over Eid-al-Fitr to break the news of a new romance with a Christian man. Her four sons, each struggling to come to terms with the death of their father, refuse to accept the new relationship.

But the movie that features their story, ‘Barakat’, is special in many ways. 

Barakat, which means blessings in Arabic, is told in Afrikaaps, a widely spoken Cape Town dialect of the Afrikaans language. It’s also the first film to be made entirely in the language, a mix of English, Dutch, Arabic, Malay and Afrikaans spoken by Muslims and mixed communities in the city. 

The neighborhood of Cape Flats, where the story is centred, is often associated with violence, crime and drugs. Instead, the film focuses on the Coloured community and celebrates their life, culture and family bonds. 

In this episode we’ll discuss ‘Barakat’ and ask why the narratives explored in the Afrikaaps language of the film are so important.

But as the death toll mounts and the healthcare system becomes overstrained, most Bulgarians are still refusing COVID-19 vaccines.
At just 23%, Bulgaria has the lowest vaccination rate in the EU, and it is not for lack of vaccines. 
Scepticism, particularly of western vaccines, is spread by misinformation online, much of it sourced to Russia.

i6CfYoMPISA,hd,"Narco-terrorists fight for control of the cocaine trade, narco-insurgents like the Taliban fund their wars with heroin – and entire narco states are built around the drug trade. There is a centuries old relationship between drugs and warfare, which Peter Andreas writes in his book 'Killer High: A History of War in Six Drugs'. Drugs we call illegal are dished out to their soldiers by their own commanders. From Nazi soldiers on methamphetamine to Britain’s global narco empire, we explore how drugs made war, and how war made drugs.

""Newsmax’s Eric Bolling attacked Sesame Street, called the Muppets communists, and challenged Miss Piggy to a debate.

Yes, really.

Big Bird, Elmo, and Rosita taught kids in a recent special why it’s important for them to get vaccinated for covid-19, now that vaccines are available for kids 5 to 11.

There was a lot of wild outrage over something Sesame Street has literally been doing for decades. Bolling weighed in on the special and said “Big Bird from Sesame Street [is] indoctrinating our five-year-olds.”

Baking soda and Epsom salts, she falsely claims, will provide a “radiation detox” to remove radiation Madej falsely believes is activated by the vaccine. Bentonite clay will add a “major pull of poison,” she says, based on a mistaken idea in anti-vaccine communities that toxins can be removed from the body with certain therapies.""

https://www.cbsnews.com/news/missouri-gun-law-second-amendment-preservation-act-60-minutes-2021-11-07/

""A new and potentially precedent-setting state gun law passed in the spring in Missouri. It's called the Second Amendment Preservation Act, or SAPA for short. It prohibits state agencies from helping the federal government enforce any law, rule, or regulation which Missouri considers an infringement on the right to bear arms. Each violation can carry a $50,000 penalty. 

Think of it like this, for a police officer in Missouri, federal gun laws, effectively, no longer exist. Missouri Democrats and lawyers at the U.S. Department of Justice argue the new law is unconstitutional, but what got our attention is that a significant number of conservative police and prosecutors who love their guns don't like this law.""

FmKs7Y21xVU,sd,"(8 Nov 2021) LEAD IN:
Fighting continued on Sunday near Marib in Yemen, a country which has been embroiled in a civil war since 2014.
Yemen's conflict has killed more than 130,000 people and spawned the world's worst humanitarian crisis.

STORY-LINE:
Fighting continued near the city of Marib in Yemen on Sunday between Iran-backed rebels and forces loyal to Yemen's internationally recognized government.
Last week, security officials said at least 200 fighters were killed in clashes between Yemen's government forces and Houthi rebels in and around the strategic central province of Marib over two days. 
Most of the casualties belonged to the Houthi forces, who have recently wrestled from their rivals most of Marib's 14 districts, according to the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to brief the media. 
The Houthis have for years attempted to take oil-rich Marib to complete their control over the northern half of Yemen. 
The Iran-backed Shiite Houthis have stepped up their push in the oil-rich province in recent weeks, while also escalating cross-border attacks on Saudi Arabia. 
The kingdom is leading a military coalition that has been fighting on the government side against the Houthis.
Yemen has been convulsed by civil war since 2014 when the Houthis captured the capital, Sanaa, and much of the north of the country, forcing the internationally recognized government to flee to the south, then to Saudi Arabia.
The Saudi-led coalition entered the war in March 2015, backed by the United States, to try to restore the government to power. 
Despite a relentless air campaign and ground fighting, the war has deteriorated largely into a stalemate and spawned the world's worst humanitarian crisis.

Ny6UxXrxWoU,sd,"(9 Nov 2021) STORYLINE: 
En el oeste de México, una pequeña unidad de soldados con media docena de camionetas y barricadas de bolsas de arena montan guardia sobre una carretera rural. 
A un lado, muy cerca, hay un puesto de control de un cartel de las drogas que extorsiona a los campesinos. Del otro, un cartel rival patrulla el lugar en camionetas que llevan sus iniciales.
El ejército mexicano ya casi no combate a los narcos aquí y sus soldados simplemente se aseguran de que las bandas no invaden territorios de otros, haciendo la vista gorda a las actividades delictivas que llevan a cabo a pocas cuadras.
El primer puesto de control fue instalado por una banda llamada los Viagras, una banda que dominó por mucho tiempo el estado de Michoacán.
A unos 3 kilómetros por la misma carretera, se ingresa a territorio del Cartel de Jalisco Nueva Generación.
Entre ambos puestos se encuentran los soldados, que hacen poco y nada.
Grupos de ciudadanos han formado patrullas comunitarias
SOUNDBITE – Dandy, miembro de grupo de defensa comunitaria¬
El cartel de Jalisco está invadiendo territorio rival en Michoacán, forzando el desplazamiento de miles de agricultores, algunos de los cuales piden asilo en Estados Unidos. 
El secretario de Defensa de México, general Luis Cresencio Sandoval, dijo públicamente que la misión de los soldados es evitar que el cartel de Jalisco penetre territorios de Michoacán.
En Aguililla, ciudad montañosa ahora dominada por Jalisco, hay casi 200 soldados que se han atrincherado en su cuartel, hostigados por residentes furiosos desde hace cuatro meses.
El ejército les hace llegar alimentos por helicóptero a sus soldados dado que los lugareños bloquearon el ingreso al cuartel a fines de junio. 
Los residentes de Aguililla dicen que no van a permitir la salida de los soldados hasta que el ejército retire los puestos de control, que hacen que sea muy difícil, o muy costosa, la llegada de insumos médicos, alimentos y equipos de reparación de artículos electrónicos y teléfonos. 
López Obrador ha tratado de evitar conflictos a todo costo desde el 2019, cuando ordenó la liberación de Ovidio Guzmán, hijo del narco detenido Joaquín ""El Chapo"" Guzmán, para que no hubiese un baño de sangre, luego de que elementos de Sinaloa salieron a la calle y empezaron a los tiros para que soltasen al hijo del Chapo.
La estrategia del gobierno de evitar conflictos obliga a la gente a tomar partido.
SOUNDBBITE - Reverendo Gilberto Vergara, sacerdote residente del área

2m6Gm7y6bOE,sd,"(8 Nov 2021) In western Mexico a group of vigilantes holding rifles guards one of the entrances to their town, Tepalcatepec, from members of the Jalisco New Generation Cartel.  
They call themselves a ""self-defence"" group. But nobody asks too much about where the Tepalcatepec vigilantes got their bulletproof cars and AR-15 rifles.  
There are rumors that the Sinaloa cartel has sent help, as part of that cartel's nationwide war with arch-rival Jalisco.  
""We are doing the government's job,"" says Dandy, a local vigilante as he drives around the hamlet of Taixtan, near Tepalcatepec. 
""Look at all the hills, without cows and cattle, there's nothing left. They (the Jalisco New Generation Cartel) stole everything."" 
The Mexican army has largely stopped fighting drug cartels here, instead ordering soldiers to guard the dividing lines between gang territories so they won't invade each other's turf.  
Most of the farmers in Tepalcatepec feel they have been left alone to fight off an invasion.
  
Like many other farmers, Antonio Valencia hasn't been able to go back to his home and has now sided with the vigilantes.  
""They (Jalisco New Generation Cartel) won't let me in(to my house),"" Valencia told the Associated Press. ""How am I going to pay all the debts I took on to cultivate my plot of land?"" 
All the residents from neighboring Plaza Vieja have also been displaced in recent months.  
""We want to get help because we have our homes here. We have always lived here, we have our animals, and we want (the government) to help us. All the people have been displaced,"" said Blanca Farías, during an outdoor mass in honor of Saint Jude Thaddeus, in which she prayed the village comes back to what it was before the Jalisco New Generation Cartel forced residents to leave.  
A woman crouches down to light a candle. She is the mother of Juan Carlos Cervantes, an 18-year-old boy recently killed by the Jalisco New Generation Cartel in a shootout.  
The family has not been able to retrieve the body nor come back to their home.  
A few kilometers away, one formally enters another cartel's territory. A homemade armored truck bearing the letters ""CJNG"" for the group's formal name, Jalisco New Generation Cartel. 
  
Between the two towns stand the soldiers, doing very little. 
Moreover, almost 200 other soldiers have been barricaded into their command post in Aguililla by angry residents for four months. 
The army has been flying in food for the troops by helicopter since townspeople used a grader and a bulldozer to block both entrances to the army barracks in late June. 
Local residents say they want the troops to free the main road blocked by the rival Viagra gang once and for all. 
Aguililla residents say they won’t let the soldiers out of their barracks until the army does its job of clearing the Viagra roadblocks that make things like medical care, food, fuel, electrical or telephone repairs impossible or expensive to get. 
  
The cartel based in Jalisco state is invading neighboring Michoacán, causing thousands of farmers to flee, with some seeking asylum in the United States.  
  
Michoacan's seaport of Lazaro Cardenas is valued by the cartels as an entry point for precursor chemicals from China used to make methamphetamine and fentanyl.  
Its avocado orchards and iron ore mines are also a prime target for extortion by the Viagras, which now controls the road to Aguililla, making the access to fuel, food and medicines very expensive, if not sometimes impossible. 
Jalisco's leader, Nemesio ""El Mencho"" Oseguera, wants to take over all this, as well as regain control of his hometown, Chila.

_e-tXgfRKn8,sd,"(8 Nov 2021) The U.S. fully reopened its borders with Mexico and Canada on Monday and lifted restrictions on travel that covered most of Europe, setting the stage for emotional reunions nearly two years in the making and providing a boost for the travel industry decimated by the pandemic.
The restrictions, among the most severe in U.S. history, kept families apart, including spouses who have not been able to hug in months, grandparents whose grandchildren doubled in age since they last saw them, and uncles and aunts who have not met nieces and nephews who are now toddlers.
At Newark International Airport in New Jersey, Mark Ogertschnig of the Netherlands was reunited with his fiancée, Natalia Abrahao after several months of separation. ""It's been tough, I think on a lot of people,"" Ogertschnig said.
The new rules also lift restrictions on air travel from some countries dating back the early days of the pandemic — as long as travelers have proof of vaccination and a negative COVID-19 test.
For Patrick Van Rosendaal, a guide for Belgian tourists, the lifting of restrictions is an economic boost. Over the past 20 months, his business has been virtual. He's excited to now be able to show tourists New York. 
Airlines are preparing for a surge in activity — especially from Europe — after the pandemic and resulting restrictions caused international travel to plunge.
The 28 European countries that were barred under the U.S. policy that just ended made up 37% of overseas visitors in 2019, according to the U.S. Travel Association. As the reopening takes effect, carriers are increasing flights between the United Kingdom and the U.S. by 21% this month over last month, according to data from travel and analytics firm Cirium. 
The U.S. will accept travelers who have been fully vaccinated with any of the shots approved for emergency use by the World Health Organization, not just those in use in the U.S. That's a relief for many in Canada, where the AstraZeneca vaccine is widely used.

cdWJUQPMBEY,sd,"(6 Nov 2021) Dozens of couples in the Bolivian capital of La Paz got married on Saturday in a mass ceremony offered by authorities to reduce the cost of the festivities. 
The 30 couples, some dressed in Indigenous formal attire, gathered in the field of a small stadium. 
Some of the couples said they had postponed a long time awaited ceremony. 
""We had to get married, but with the quarantine and the pandemic we've delayed it,"" said  Maribel Morales.
Social services reduced the normal price of the paperwork by half and donated champagne and the cost of the musicians' services, who performed a waltz. 
The event was the first mass ceremony after some COVID-19 restrictions had been lifted in Bolivia.

3avrJR_skx4,sd,"(10 Nov 2021) Glasgow residents on their bicycles held a protest on Wednesday outside the gates of the COP26 venue demanding cycling and active travel to be on the summit agenda as a solution to climate change.
Protesters with their bicycles held up signs reading ""This Machine Fights Climate Change.""
""Bicycles are a very important form of transport, which apparently is not being discussed at COP,"" said Trisha Fort, Glasgow resident. 
""We can have as many electric cars as people want, but they'll still cause the congestion, the obesity, everything else.""
Fridays For Future also held a protest inside the COP26 venue at the German Pavilion calling on the current German government to pay a fair share for the 1.5 degrees target. 
""The Germans and the global north countries, they have contributed a lot to our suffering,"" said Ugandan Fridays For Future activist Patience Nabukalu.
""They have snatched our happiness and our future plus the present from the people in the global south, and they are not ready to pay their debts,"" she added.
So far the conference has produced headline-grabbing announcements in areas including ending coal power, funding green technology and reversing deforestation.
But the almost 200 nations attending remain far from sealing a deal that could limit global warming to the internationally agreed goal of 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial levels.
There is also an unkept promise from rich nations to give more money to the countries most vulnerable to climate change -- often developing nations that have done least to cause it.
COP26 is due to end Friday, though the talks could stretch on longer.

V3-suIRd19c,sd,"(10 Nov 2021) CREW MEMBER SUES ALEC BALDWIN, OTHERS OVER 'RUST' SHOOTING
The head of lighting on the film ""Rust"" has filed a lawsuit over Alec Baldwin's fatal shooting of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins on the New Mexico set of the Western, alleging negligence that caused him ""severe emotional distress"" that will haunt him forever.
Serge Svetnoy said in the suit that the bullet that killed his close friend Hutchins, narrowly missed him, and he held her head as she died.
""I was so concentrated and I tried to save her life. I just hold her, I spoke with her all the time -- all this 20, 30 minutes,"" Svetnoy said Wednesday (10 NOVEMBER) at a news conference in Los Angeles alongside his attorney Gary A. Dordick.
The lawsuit filed in Los Angeles Superior Court names nearly two dozen defendants associated with the film including Baldwin, who was both star and a producer; David Halls, the assistant director who handed Baldwin the gun; and Hannah Gutierrez Reed, who was in charge of weapons on the set.  
It is the first known lawsuit of what could be many stemming from the Oct. 21 shooting, which also injured ""Rust"" director Joel Souza. It was the ninth film that Svetnoy and Hutchins had worked on together, and he had taken the job at low pay because she asked him to.
""She was my friend,"" Svetnoy said at the news conference.
He said he had seen guns sitting unattended in the dirt a few days earlier in the shoot, and had warned the people responsible about them.
The lawsuit seeks both compensatory and punitive damages to be determined later. Attorneys and representatives for the defendants did not immediately respond to email and phone messages seeking comment on the suit.
Gutierrez Reed said last week that she had inspected the gun Baldwin shot but doesn't know how a live bullet ended up inside.
Authorities have said that Halls, the assistant director, handed the weapon to Baldwin and announced ""cold gun,"" indicating that the weapon was safe to use.

dt3rQaoNjt0,sd,"(9 Nov 2021) In Ethiopia's capital Addis Ababa, residents have spoken of their distress as the African Union’s envoy for the Horn of Africa warned Monday there is little time to reverse the crisis in northern Ethiopia which has drastically deteriorated in recent weeks.
It came amid an escalating offensive by Tigray forces against the government.
There are signs of a deepening crisis that is affecting ordinary citizens here too. 
Schools have been shut because of the war and the pandemic is making it a tough year for everyone. 
It looks like business as usual, but beneath the surface undercover security officers are watching. 
Foreign journalists are viewed with suspicion. 
There is tension in the air and people are struggling to make ends meet in this war economy. 
Kinfe Degu, sells watches on the streets. 
Times are tough these days. ""Yes we are losing money but even if we have to sacrifice our lives we are ready to do that in order to save our country."" 
Young people are being urged to join the army and fight. 
Weekly rallies calling on volunteers to take up arms are on the rise.
But many young people are worried for themselves and their country. 
""I really can't say much about this war. When you think of the number of people killed, we cannot even plan for tomorrow. Losing our county and our people is like losing ourselves,"" says 22-year-old Helen Gezahegn, a secretary at one of Ethiopia's private hospitals. 
And schools are not faring any better. 
Many schools have been shut down because of the pandemic and also the war, but yesterday the minister of education said national exams would resume after they had been postponed for the past four months.
But many students in the embattled Tigray and Amhara regions will not be able to sit exams due to the insecurity.
Many schools in and around the areas of conflict have become shelters for 1.7 million displaced by the fighting. 
Ethiopia's Minister of Education Birhanu Nega visited students as they were taking their exams in the Ethiopian capital Addis Ababa on Monday. 
The education minister told reporters that over 600,000 students are taking the national exams, a prerequisite to enroll in universities and for higher education institutions.
Out of the registered students, the minister says 91.5% of them are sitting for the exam. Students in the conflict area are expected to take the exam in the coming month without elaborating how. 
Some of the students say that the war has given them more time for preparation, but delayed their chances of enrolling in university on time.

JUqQy86WqFo,sd,"(9 Nov 2021) French President Emmanuel Macron on Tuesday formally sealed an agreement to give back 26 artworks to Benin as part of broader efforts to return art looted during colonial times. 
Macron met with his counterpart from Benin, President Patrice Talon, who thanked the president for his courage ""which has allowed us to step over the taboo of restitution.""
After a signing ceremony in the presence of the two countries' culture ministers, Talon said he hoped this first restitution would be followed by more.
""The restitution of 26 artworks we are celebrating today is only a step in the ambitious process of equity and of restitution of memorial heritage extorted from the territory of the Benin kingdom by France,"" Talon said.
The wooden anthropomorphic statues, royal thrones and sacred altars were pilfered by the French army 129 years ago. 
The French had a final glimpse of the objects, from the collection known as the ""Abomey Treasures,"" in the Musée du quai Branly–Jacques Chirac last month.
Benin is founding a new museum in Abomey, partly funded by the French government, that will ultimately house the works.

YnjgvbCBKW8,sd,"(9 Nov 2021) Schools for girls from grades 7 to 12 have reopened in Afghanistan's third largest city, Herat, in what appeared to be a localized change in the Taliban's bar on classes for girls of that age.
Since seizing power nearly three months ago, the Taliban have been under international pressure to allow all girls to go to school. 
There was no immediate confirmation from Taliban officials that girls were allowed back in Herat, a city in the west of the country.
At least 26 schools for girls above grade 6 have reopened in Herat city. 
So far, none are known to have reopened elsewhere in the province, also called Herat.
""I wish that the schools in all over Afghanistan start soon and girls and women have the right to study and build the society."" Amena Haidari, a 12th grade student said.
The first time they were in power, from 1996 to 2001, the hard-line Taliban barred all women and girls from school and work. 
""When the schools were closed the students became disappointed and depressed,"" Toba Noorzayee, Ostad Fekri Saljuqi girls' high school director said.
The growth in girls' school attendance and women in the work force was considered one of the main achievements of the past 20 years under the U.S.-backed government.
Since the Taliban ousted that government on Aug. 15, the international community has refused to recognize the Taliban government until it meets a list of demands, including respect for women's rights and schooling for girls. 
The newly ruling Taliban have allowed boys of all years to return to school, but only allowed girls in primary school and women at private universities to continue. 
Teenage girls, aged 12 to 17, were not allowed back.
The new Taliban government has said that some form of education for girls and women will be permitted, but it has not given a time frame or clarified what education facilities would be allowed.

AIS5_Sbn6Ig,sd,"(6 Nov 2021) United under the slogan ""Stop the electricity scam"", hundreds of people marched through Barcelona on Saturday, protesting against rises in the price of electricity.
Consumer prices in Spain increased in October by the highest rate in 29 years as a result of soaring electricity costs, preliminary data from the National Statistics Institute show. 
The institute, known by its Spanish acronym INE, said consumer prices rose 5.5% in October compared to the same month in 2020. 
Despite drastic measures that have pitted the Spanish government against big electricity firms, regulatory changes so far have not contained the rising utility bills that the country's residents and companies are seeing as a result of a global wholesale energy price crunch. 
INE said that apart from the cost of electricity, increases in fuel and gas prices also fueled the monthly consumer price hike. 
Spain's consumer prices went up 4% in September compared to the same month in 2020.

1NbnGSYWkLM,sd,"(10 Nov 2021) A pair of diamond bracelets that once belonged to Marie Antoinette, the famed wife of French King Louis XVI who met her fate at the revolutionary guillotine, sold for 7.46 million Swiss francs ($8.34 million) to a private collector on Tuesday — well over the pre-sale estimate.
The opulent bracelets, among the rare pieces of jewelry from the ill-fated French royal that are still up for public sale today, were among standout features to a Christie's auction in Geneva. 
The pre-sale estimate for the bracelets, featuring 112 diamonds and each weighing 97 grams (3.4 ounces) and including silver and gold, was between 2 million and 4 million Swiss francs.
The final price included taxes and fees on top of the hammer price. The buyer was not identified. 
After Marie Antoinette's death in the French Revolution in 1793, the bracelets that had been commissioned some 17 years earlier were passed on from her daughter Marie-Therese and kept within royal lineage for over 200 years, Christie's said.
On Wednesday, as part of regular Geneva jewelry auctions, rival house Sotheby's is set to put under the hammer a 26.8-carat oval sapphire surrounded by diamonds, and matching ear clips that once belonged to Grand Duchess Maria Pavlovna of Russia — pieces that were whisked out of Russia during the country's 1917 revolution. 
The trio is expected to garner as much as 480,000 francs ($525,800).

wuQfNxzcZYY,sd,"(9 Nov 2021) The chief of the German Navy on Tuesday said the dispatch of a German frigate to the Indo-Pacific underscores his country's worry peace and free navigation were being threatened in the region, hinting at but without naming China.  
Vice Admiral Kay-Achim Schoenbach was in Tokyo to mark the German warship Bayern's port call in Japan as part of its deployment.
He said escalating contentions, territorial disputes and a changing military balance in the Indo-Pacific can cause an extensive impact beyond Asia.
Schoenbach said the Bayern also will pass through the South China Sea to demonstrate its right to sail its waters without interference.
The frigate arrived in Tokyo on Friday, becoming a first Germany warship to visit Japan in nearly 20 years. 
One of the Bayern's key missions while in the area is to monitor for three week beginning mid-November under a UN Security Council resolution of maritime activities by North Korean ships, including possible ship-to-ship transfers of banned cargoes in regional seas.
It will be Germany's first participation in the mission that started in 2018 and has since been joined by New Zealand, Australia, the United States, Canada, Britain and France, as well as Japan.

ElXYowPLYpE,sd,"(8 Nov 2021) France showcased its military muscle on Monday with a tour of its new frigate Auvergne to underscore what the ship's captain said was the importance that Paris attaches to ensuring security and stability in the east Mediterranean.  
Captain Paul Merveilleux de Vignaux said the Auvergne with its 150-strong crew would be deployed in the east Mediterranean until January to gather intelligence in order to ""show how the respect of international law and especially freedom of navigation matters"" to France.
""This deployment underlines how important France considers this part of the Mediterranean sea,"" as well as the country's ""willingness to contribute to the stabilization of this strategic area,"" de Vignaux told reporters at the Cypriot port of Larnaca.
The Auvergne was commissioned three years ago and has been deployed numerous times primarily in the east Mediterranean. The vessel with its advanced sonar equipment specializes in anti-submarine warfare.  
De Vignaux said this is the twelfth time that the Auvergne has visited Cyprus which he called as key to supporting French naval operations in the region.
""There can't be efficient and sustainable naval operations without support and Cyprus is the centerpiece of it,"" de Vignaux said.
The French aircraft carrier Charles de Gaulle has also made repeated trips to Cyprus.
Relations between Cyprus and France have been growing tighter in recent years. 
Cyprus also permits French aircraft to use its military air base in the southern eastern corner of the island nation and has an agreement for French ships to use its southern naval port that's currently undergoing an upgrade.  
France is also keen to make its presence felt in the region to send signals to Turkey not to interfere with offshore drilling by French energy company Total and its Italian partner Eni next year in waters off Cyprus' southern coast.
Turkey doesn't recognize Cyprus as a state and contests waters where the Cypriot government Cyprus claims exclusive economic rights. 
Ankara says that a large chunk of those waters either overlap its continental shelf or belong to breakaway Turkish Cypriots.
Cyprus was split in 1974 when Turkey invaded after a coup by supporters of union with Greece. 
Only Turkey recognizes a 1983 Turkish Cypriot declaration of independence in the island's northern third where it maintains more than 35,000 troops.
In February 2018, Turkish warships prevented a drill ship leased by Eni from conducting exploratory drilling in waters southeast of Cyprus.  
The French naval presence also aims to serve notice to Turkey that a perceived power vacuum in the east Mediterranean will be filled by Paris and not Ankara, said political analyst Anna Koukkides-Procopiou.  
""(French President Emmanuel) Macron needs to project this power in the region because this is part of his whole policy of establishing or re-establishing France as a great power, which is not only dominant in the region in the Middle East, but (in) Africa,"" Koukkides-Procopiou told the Associated Press.
""No vacuums ever exist, so someone had to move in and fill that vacuum. Now France wants to make sure that it's not Turkey,"" she said.

DHKo0pKUPns,sd,"(9 Nov 2021) As Eastern Congo has seen an uptick in violence in recent weeks, the Congo army alongside peacekeepers from the U.N. mission, known as MONUSCO, have continued their patrols of local districts caught up in the fighting.
Komanda, located in the Eastern province of Ituri, is one village that was retaken from rebel groups last month, according to the military. 
Calm has returned to the town's central thoroughfare and government soldiers can now be seen patrolling the streets.
Signs of the rebels retreat however are still visible. 
Parts of the village have been destroyed, with shop fronts and homes left burned and charred. 
One local resident, shopkeeper Kambale Fiston, told the Associated Press that seven people were killed.
""Look behind you, beyond the houses, they were set on fire by the rebels, the damage is enormous"" he said.
While Fiston decided to stay in the village, other residents have fled; columns of their cars laden with belongings line the nearby roads.
One of those fleeing the violence was Marie Claire Kavira and her children.
""We are scared, we don't know if we are safe here because every time we are waiting for the bullets to hit. It is not safe. The children cry and we don't have anything to eat"" she said.
Video footage from the AP following local troops in Komanda and Bunia - the capital of the Ituri province - showed soldiers last month patrolling through the towns and surrounding areas.
Lt. Gen. Johnny Luboya Nkashama, the military governor of Ituri, told the AP that his soldiers began their operation at the start of Oct. and that they successfully reclaimed several villages.
""Now the rebels are fleeing, and as they retreat they are attacking the local populations,"" Nkashama said.
""Last week, they were here and we pushed them out,"" he added.
During a joint Congolese army-MONUSCO night patrol in Bunia, members of the UN mission in the country distributed toll-free numbers to local inhabitants, so they can quickly call local authorities in the event of any danger, an initiative intended to ensure a sense of security in the town, according to a MONUSCO officer.
Despite the efforts by the authorities, the head of Ituri's MONUSCO office, Josiah Obat, said the security situation has become more tense in recent weeks and that there are many obstacles facing the region; problems that have been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic.
""The solutions are not only military, there are many steps that must be taken politically. When we talk about community dialogue, the civil affairs section works in collaboration with all the communities, the community leaders bring the communities together to discuss the issues,"" he said. 
In the most recent episode of violence in the region this week, Congo's military said that members of the M23 rebellion group had attacked a base in eastern Congo's Rutshuru area. 
The rebel group denied any involvement in the attack. 
More than 120 rebel groups continue to operate across large swathes of eastern Congo since the official end of the civil wars in 2003.

bGqnGGdlCdk,sd,"(9 Nov 2021) FOR CLEAN VERSION SEE STORY NUMBER: 4352259

Schools for girls from grades 7 to 12 have reopened in Afghanistan's third largest city, Herat, in what appeared to be a localized change in the Taliban's bar on classes for girls of that age.
Since seizing power nearly three months ago, the Taliban have been under international pressure to allow all girls to go to school.
There was no immediate confirmation from Taliban officials that girls were allowed back in Herat, a city in the west of the country.
At least 26 schools for girls above grade 6 have reopened in Herat city.
So far, none are known to have reopened elsewhere in the province, also called Herat.
The first time they were in power, from 1996 to 2001, the hard-line Taliban barred all women and girls from school and work.
The growth in girls' school attendance and women in the work force was considered one of the main achievements of the past 20 years under the U.S.-backed government.
Since the Taliban ousted that government on Aug. 15, the international community has refused to recognize the Taliban government until it meets a list of demands, including respect for women's rights and schooling for girls.
The newly ruling Taliban have allowed boys of all years to return to school, but only allowed girls in primary school and women at private universities to continue.
Teenage girls, aged 12 to 17, were not allowed back.
The new Taliban government has said that some form of education for girls and women will be permitted, but it has not given a time frame or clarified what education facilities would be allowed.

F4U7UNYqoQ4,sd,"(8 Nov 2021) LEAD IN:
An ambitious start-up company which has received hefty funding from investors is rolling out electric buses in Kenya.
With all eyes on world leaders at COP26 to make clear pledges to curb global warming, it's hoped that in Kenya replacing standard buses with electric ones will help limit carbon emissions.

STORY-LINE: 
In Kenya, a startup company called Opibus is chartering an ambitious path to achieving a zero emissions public transportation system. 
The company is on a mission to refit electric engines into diesel and petrol buses that have the capacity to travel over 250 kilometres a day on a single charge.
Public service vehicle drivers in the country are excited.
""The price of fuel is very high and you cannot make good money because you use a lot of money on fuel, comparing it with the upcoming electric bus, we will make more money and even the owner of the bus will get a lot of money,"" says George Moses, a public bus driver who works in Nairobi.
As unrelenting threats of climate change continue to threaten the planet, carbon emissions from vehicles still remain one of the biggest problems.
Africa as a whole is vulnerable to the consequences, yet comparatively, it has overall contributed very little to global warming.
Filip Lovstrom is the Founder of OPIBUS.
""We remove the internal combustion engine, we replace that with an electric motor, and then we put a battery pack and a control unit to it. Which means that suddenly we no longer have to go to the petrol station to fuel our buses or our vehicles with petrol or diesel,"" he says.
However the cost of refitting a fuel run engine with an electric engine is too high for many owners in the public service vehicle industry. 
The cost is approximately 45 thousand US dollars whereas a second hand bus imported into Kenya usually costs about a third less.
Most of the parts for the electric buses also have to be imported into Kenya from Europe adding to the cost of going green.
The Kenyan government is also taxing the electric components used in assembling the electric buses. 
With big odds already on the horizon for the company, Silicon Valley Fund At One Ventures has sunk a whopping $7.5 million to fund Opibus, currently Africa's largest electric car manufacturing company. 
This will see the electric car company complete the modification of the first 52 passenger vehicle into a fully electric vehicle by December 2021.
Mass productions of over 20,000 others will be rolled out to cover Africa's market by 2023. 
""We don't have to look at the cost of fuel every morning as we wake up, but we can actually drive vehicles that reduce the cost of operating so much. That Kenya as a country and us as individuals become independent of oil prices and both on emission side and for our wallets,"" says Lovstrom.
By modifying the already existing vehicle chassis, Opibus reduces carbon emissions by almost 100% while reducing operational cost by approximately 60% since electric buses will not need costly oil and fuel to keep them on the road.
Although bus drivers believe they could ultimately make more money, the truth of the matter is electric buses are not cheap and the Lithium batteries that help keep the buses moving lose charge by about 2 percent per year. 
So within 10 years an electric bus is likely to lose 20 percent of its power, reducing the distance it can travel. 
Eventually the Lithium batteries will need a costly replacement and disposing of old Lithium batteries may be another environmental challenge.

HgNu9wvwLf0,sd,"(9 Nov 2021) An historic First World War soldier's house in Belgium has been able to stay open despite the COVID-19 pandemic, amid a crowdsourcing campaign to help keep it running. 
Talbot House is an institution in so-called ""remembrance tourism"", a Western Front meeting house where Commonwealth soldiers gatheered to escape the battle in Flanders fields. 
For generations since, people found history, solace, wisdom and an understanding at Talbot House about why the motto of this region in western Belgium is ""Never into war again."" 
But for months last year, a COVID-19 lockdown closed the club.
Going from as many as 500 guests a day, Talbot House manager Simon Louagie sometimes found himself alone. 
But speaking to The Associated Press, Louagie said that when funds were running low and doors were closed, only one thought ran through his head: ""Not on my watch."" 
""We cannot disappoint all those generations before us by letting it close down,"" he said. 
Crowdfunding was the answer for Louagie. 
Last year, a 98-year-old World War II veteran raised money by walking from a war graves cemetery to Talbot House, cheered on by locals who pulled money out of their wallet when they were not applauding. When a local died, the family asked that instead of flowers, mourners donate money to Talbot House.
""It became very emotional when I saw how many people cared so deeply,"" Louagie said.
Since the end of World War I in 1918, millions of visitors - from as far away as the United States New Zealand, and South Africa - have flocked to memorials in northern France and Belgium to pay tribute to the fallen.
Now, closing in on two years of the pandemic and travel restrictions, the tourist industry welcoming them is crippled. Lockdowns and travel restrictions, of which many remain in place, are keeping foreign visitors away.  
Another Armistice Day beckons on November 11 and the outlook remains bleak. 
Nick Benoot, who runs the small Hooge Crater Museum not far from Poperinge could not believe it when at the end of 2019, schools started to cancel trips because of reports of a virus in Wuhan, China. 
Like Louagie, he had plunged money into the business to keep it going amid the pandemic, and needed any income he could get.
From 65,000 paying visitors in 2017 to just 3,000 last year, the numbers demonstrated how remembrance tourism slumped throughout the region. 
""It was like we went bankrupt. We had to close everything down,"" he said. 
Even as his income dwindled in the middle of the pandemic, Benoot understood that the message of ""the war to end all wars"" still needed to be passed on to younger generations. 
Now, as virus measures are being eased after Belgium's COVID-19 vaccination campaign, the managers of institutions like Louagie's and Benoot's are hoping they will see a return of the tourists. 
""We don't do what all the rest does. So I think we have a way to survive,"" Benoot said. 
Even the Last Post ceremony in nearby Ypres - a daily, mournful bugle call harking back to 1928 that had only briefly stopped during World War II - was at risk of being silenced. The tradition has the bugle playing under the Menin Gate where some 55,000 names of soldiers whose remains were never found are engraved.
Yet it pulled through. Volunteers refused to stop and pulled strings all the way up to the top political posts to ensure its continuation even if it had to be scaled down. 
""During COVID, there was only one bugler and the names of 55,000 soldiers,"" said Benoit Mottrie, the head of the Last Post Association.

krCjME7GEFY,sd,"(9 Nov 2021) Hundreds gathered on Monday at a goldmine where 18 people died after a collapse in Niger's Dan Issa township. 
Authorities in Niger said the people were killed when the mine partially collapsed on Sunday in the region located in the south of the country, near the border with Nigeria. 
Governor of Maradi region Aboubacar Chaibou visited the site on Monday, telling The Associated Press that authorities were going to ""review governor of Maradi region"" in order to improve conditions.
Local authorities said that thousands have been arriving at the place to work on the recently discovered mine.
According to Mayor of Dan Issa Adamou Guero there have been difficulties in controlling and organizing the work at the site. 
Niger is one of the world's poorest countries, also affected by violence that has caused the internal displaced of thousands fleeing from extremist groups operating in the country.

g4DrrTa1w-A,sd,"(8 Nov 2021) LEAD IN:
British defence company Ultra Electronics unveiled a working prototype of a mind-controlled drone at the Three Counties Defence and Security Expo (3CDSE) in Malvern, England, on 4 November.
All the pilot has to do is to focus their attention and eyes on specific circles on a computer screen.

STORY-LINE:
This drone takes off, spins and lands without a remote control.
The person sitting behind the laptop controls its movements by thought only.
This new technology was developed by Ultra Electronics, a British company working in the defence and security industry.
The drone and the brain sensor were already available on the market, so Ultra Electronics designed a software to make the two devices work together.
Although the laptop does have a webcam, it is not used to look at the user — the focus of the mind on the circles instructs the drone what to do via the brain sensor worn on the users head. 
""So what happens is that we create some icons, we call them tags, and they have like a signal within them,"" explains Tony White, CTO of land systems at Ultra Electronics.
""And when you stare at that, your eye responds to it in a particular way. The way in which the eye response occurs is a signal that we pick up on the visual cortex of the brain, at the back of the brain. So the sensor is looking for the signals we create here that come through the eyeball through the brain and then onto the visual cortex. Once we've got it there as a signal, we can grab that, we understand what that signal looks like and we can turn that into a command for whatever we're trying to control.""
There are four circles on the computer screen in total: two big ones for take-off and landing, and two small ones for spinning left and right.
The advantage of this technology is to reduce the number of hand-held controllers for soldiers.
""So this device is all about providing control of other devices the soldier might carry. And when you think about what a soldier does, most of his time he wants his hands on a weapon. And each time I've got to take my hands off the weapon to do something, I may, may, be vulnerable. So by having this device, it allows him to be in control of things once he's still got his hands on the weapon,"" says White.
The prototype was designed in partnership with Neuro8, a neuroscience consultancy company founded by Ellen Kay.
She led trainings for Ultra Electronics employees and helped the drone project by helping the pilots focus.
""So what happens is, is that having gone through the training, the organisation had a much better understanding of the individual and how the brain and body communicate. And from a soldier's wellbeing and welfare that's just as important as them optimising their performance. So how this worked for us is that they developed the technology and I used all of the techniques that I've learnt through the training and through the coaching to use the technology to show how the human can improve their performance and reduce their cognitive burden, to use this technology better,"" explains Kay. 
The drone was demoed at the Three Counties Defence and Security Expo (3CDSE) in Malvern, England, on 4 November.
This mind controlling is an example of a brain-computer interface (BCI), meaning a technology that is able to understand the brain and translate what the user thinks into actions.
On stage and in front of an audience, the drone was also used by a person who had never used it before.
After a 2-minute calibration process, the new pilot was able to control the drone, make it take off and land on a table, and rotate it in the air.

eIt1_oiTfpg,sd,"(6 Nov 2021) A second day of heavy floods in the surburbs of Sarajevo wrought more havoc on the Bosnian capital on Saturday, despite water levels decreasing. 
The Zeljeznica and Tilava rivers in southern Sarajevo burst their banks and flooded hundreds of homes in the area. 
Civil protection teams and local residents struggled to put up sand bag barriers.
On Friday, heavy rain caused severe flash flooding prompting evacuations, power outages and submerged roads.
z
Hundreds of homes in the Sarajevo suburbs, along the rivers Bosnia, Tilava and Zeljeznica, and in the southwest part of the country, around the town of Konjic, had to be evacuated under unrelenting heavy downpours.  
Rain started late on Thursday and forecasts say it will continue to fall until Sunday, raising fears of a repeat of record flooding that affected about a third of the population in 2014.
It followed days of unseasonably warm weather with temperatures over 20 degrees Celsius.

MronBTaDYEY,sd,"(8 Nov 2021) Israeli President Isaac Herzog on Monday welcomed his Colombian counterpart Ivan Duque to begin a three-day visit to Israel.
Colombia is to open a trade office in Jerusalem, a move seen by Israel as support for its claim of sovereignty over the city. Colombia's embassy is in Tel Aviv.
Herzog hailed Colombia's accession to the Board of Governors of the International Atomic Energy Agency and urged the country to use its role in the world body to pressure Iran into giving up its nuclear program.
""I hope that this position will allow you to promote diplomatic efforts to fight the Iranian nuclear program,"" Herzog said.
Duque is to meet with Prime Minister Naftali Bennett during the day and will lay a wreath at the Yad Vashem Holocaust Remembrance Centre in Jerusalem.

8K6f0HvB7_I,sd,"(7 Nov 2021) LEAD IN:
Art is not widely practised in culturally conservative Somalia, which has suffered decades of conflict.
In a country where women are still marginalised in many aspects of daily life, 21-year-old painter Sana Ashraf Sharif Muhsin is making an impact. 
She believes that through her paintings, she can help rebuild her country. 

STORY-LINE:
21-year-old painter Sana Ashraf Sharif Muhsin lives in Mogadishu, Somalia.
She wants to help her country - which has been ravaged by civil war on and off over decades - through her paintings.
Art in many countries still suffering a shadow war, is seen by dictatorial and violent regimes as an expression of dissent.
Artists are rare in Somalia, a once-taboo profession which managed to only just survive through conflicts and Islamic extremism.
Years of insecurity marked by devastating attacks by the al-Qaida-linked al-Shabab extremist group have plagued the country.
Sana Ashraf Sharif Muhsin has suffered more opposition than most.
She lives and works amid the rubble of her uncle's building that was partially destroyed in Mogadishu's years of war.
""As a Somali woman and artist I love my country and since we have passed through 30 years of destruction, and the people only see bad things, having in mind bloodied with destruction and explosions. I believe that I can change that through my arts to let them see something beautiful and build their morale,"" she says. 
Despite the challenges, that include the belief by some Muslims that Islam bars all representations of people, and the struggle to actually get hold of materials to produce the paintings, Sana is optimistic. 
""I love my work and believe that I can contribute to the rebuilding and pacifying of my country,"" she says.
Sana, a civil engineering student, began drawing at the age of 8, following in the footsteps of her maternal uncle, Abdikarim Osman Addow, a well-known artist.
She started off using charcoal on the walls of her house, then progressed to forming a sketchbook with depictions of household items like a shoe or a jug of water.
But as her work brought her more public attention over the years, some tensions followed.
""I fear for myself sometimes,"" she says, and recalled a confrontation during a recent exhibition at the City University of Mogadishu. 
A male student began shouting ""This is wrong!"" and professors tried to calm him, explaining that art is an important part of the world.
Many people in Somalia don't understand the arts, Sana says, and some even criticize them as disgusting. 
At exhibitions, she tries to make people understand that art is useful and ""a weapon that can be used for many things.""
A teacher once challenged her skills by asking questions and requiring answers in the form of a drawing, she says.
""Everything that's made is first drawn, and what we're making is not the dress but something that changes your internal emotions,"" Sana says. 
""Our paintings talk to the people.""
Her work at times explores the social issues relevant to Somalia, including a painting of a soldier looking at the ruins of the country's first parliament building. 
It reflects the current political clash between the federal government and opposition, she says, as national elections are delayed. 
Another painting reflects abuses against vulnerable young women ""which they cannot even express."" 
A third shows a woman in the bare-shouldered dress popular in Somalia decades ago before a stricter interpretation of Islam took hold and scholars urged women to wear the hijab.
But finding role models at home for her profession doesn't come easily.

93wH5CRd4NM,sd,"(8 Nov 2021) Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov on Monday criticised the United States for calling into question the results of Nicaragua's presidential election.
In a statement released around the close of voting on Sunday, President Joe Biden called the election process “rigged” and said the US would use the tools at its disposal to hold the Nicaraguan government accountable.
""The White House announced its refusal to recognise it and called on other countries to do the same. We consider it unacceptable and firmly condemn such a policy,"" Lavrov told reporters at a joint press conference with his Venezuelan counterpart Felix Plasencia at the Russian Foreign Ministry.  
Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega sought a fourth consecutive term in elections Washington has called a ""pantomime"" following the jailing of his top rivals and the country's opposition has urged voters to boycott. 
  
Lavrov also said recent NATO drills in the Black Sea were about pursuing a policy of  ""containment"" towards Russia.
Moscow has repeatedly voiced concerns over the deployment of NATO forces near Russian borders, describing it as a threat to its security. 
Russia and the alliance also have continuously accused each other of dangerous and provocative manoeuvres at sea and in the air. 
Plasencia told reporters his country was thankful to Russia for its support during the coronavirus pandemic.
Venezuela ordered 10 million doses of the Russian-developed Sputnik V jab in December 2020. 
Sputnik V is not among the seven vaccines cleared by the World Health Organization in the fight against COVID-19.

tvcxNVs9K6g,sd,"(7 Nov 2021) LEAD IN:
Led by their riders, horses performed to the beat of traditional Egyptian songs at a dressage competition in Giza. 
In dressage, human rider and horse perform a series of movements at different paces - a walk, trot and canter - set to music to demonstrate their artistic and technical prowess.

STORY-LINE:
To the sound of music and applause from cheering fans, horses regaled a crowd in Egypt with dressage performances on Friday.  
With their riders leading the way, the horses trotted along, harmonizing their moves with the rhythm of the songs blasting in the background. 
The performances were part of the third edition of Egypt's International Championship for Horse Taming.  
With each move calculated and carefully rehearsed, the performances showed the horses' flexibility and their riders' mastery. 
The Egyptian version of dressage is regularly featured as a form of entertainment in rural weddings and other gatherings. 
The horses have to be at least three years old before they can learn dressage moves. 
They also have to have the right muscular build and spirit, says Mohamed Akl, the manager of the venue where the contest was hosted. 
There were around 45 Arabian horses performing in the show including 30 registered horses.  
A jury judged the performances and gave each participant a score, before winners were announced. 
The first place winner for the registered horses won a prize worth 50,000 Egyptian pounds ($3,180), while the prize for the unregistered horse was worth 25,000 pounds (around $1,590). 
As part of their training, horses first learn how to perform dressage moves on their own. 
Afterwards, they learn how to carry out the steps prompted by their riders.

Von der Leyen also asked EU member states to approve extended sanctions against Belarusian authorities.
Polish riot police reinforced the border at Kuznica on Tuesday, a day after hundreds of migrants tried to storm across the razor-wire border fence.

bX-nMpFULFE,sd,"(6 Nov 2021) European Union officials on Friday continued their observation as Venezuela's election campaigns got underway.
The EU observer mission was in Venezuela at the invitation of the government, and the urging of the opposition.
The team of 44 observers, that arrived in Venezuela on October 24, was deployed throughout the country to examine the electoral process from the campaigning to the November 21 election day.
On Friday they observed a 68-year-old voter trying out a new electoral machine that was installed at a public square in Los Teques city in Miranda state –36 kilometers (22 miles) east of Caracas. 
Noris García said the observers were welcome in Venezuela, as she tried out the machine.
""It is good that they are here and that they bring the truth about Venezuela to the world so that it is not misrepresented.""
Xabier Meilan, the Deputy Chief Observer of the EU Election Observation Mission, said the officials were not in Venezuela for the purpose of ""legitimizing or delegitimizing (the government).""
The EU, which did not recognize the country's legislative elections last year, has not sent observers to a Venezuelan election since 2006.
""We understand that if after 15 years (of not coming to Venezuela to observe an election) we are here (again), they have called us to come back, it must be for a reason,"" said Meilan.
The European mission will carry out an independent, technical evaluation of the entire electoral process and will make recommendations for future elections, he said.

LJ9dp8YAsuY,sd,"(8 Nov 2021) Hungary's Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto and his visiting Latvian counterpart on Monday discussed the increasing pressure of illegal migration on the external borders of the European Union.
Latvia's Edgars Rinkevics was in the Hungarian capital to mark the 100th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic ties between the two countries. 
""There has never been a situation like this in Europe in terms of migration,"" said Szijjarto.
""Our continent is under direct pressure from three directions: on the southern Mediterranean sea route, on the south-eastern western Balkan land route and from the eastern direction.""
Since the summer, Poland and Lithuania have faced the pressure of migrants from the Middle East and Africa trying to cross into the EU. 
Poland has sought to block the attempts or send those they catch back into Belarus. 
Warsaw and the EU say it’s an organized action by the Belarusian government aimed at destabilizing the bloc in retaliation for Western sanctions.
Poland on Monday increased security at its border with Belarus, on the European Union’s eastern border, after a large group of migrants in Belarus appeared to be congregating by the frontier, seeking to try to force their way into Poland, officials said.
Rinkevics said migration was being used as a ""hybrid weapon to attack the borders of the European Union"", notably on the Latvian, Lithuanian and Polish borders with Belarus. 
Szijjarto and Rinkevics called on the EU to provide financial assistance to member states in their efforts to protect the border.

ggPt_9tU5bE,sd,"(10 Nov 2021) The Pentagon says it is closely watching ""unusual military activity,"" including a buildup of troops, inside Russia, near Ukraine's borders.
""It's unusual in its size and scope,"" said spokesman John Kirby in a briefing Wednesday with reporters, adding, ""We remain concerned about that.""
Ukraine's Defense Ministry said last Wednesday that about 90,000 Russian troops are stationed not far from the border and in rebel-controlled areas in Ukraine's east. 
Russia has cast its weight behind a separatist insurgency in Ukraine's east that erupted shortly after Moscow's 2014 annexation of Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula and has left more than 14,000 people dead. Russia has repeatedly denied any presence of its troops in eastern Ukraine.
Earlier this year, a massive buildup of Russian troops in the Russia's west raised concern in Ukraine and in the West, fueling fears of an escalation of large-scale hostilities.
Russian officials said the troops were deployed for maneuvers, casting them as part of measures to counter security threats posed by the deployment of NATO forces near Russian borders. Russia and the alliance also have blamed each other for conducting destabilizing military exercises near the borders.
Kirby said the U.S. urges Russia ""to be transparent with the international community about what this means, what they're doing and to respect the international community's will about Ukrainian sovereignty and territorial integrity.""

8hG8uAtE5yQ,sd,"(10 Nov 2021) STORYLINE: 
A top Taliban official on Wednesday urged former Afghan military pilots to remain in the country, saying they were protected by a national amnesty and would not face arrest.
The comments by chief government spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid came amid reports that more than 140 U.S.-trained Afghan pilots and crew members left Tajikistan in a U.S.-brokered evacuation Tuesday, three months after they sought refuge there from a Taliban takeover of Afghanistan. The Associated Press could not immediately confirm the reports independently.
Afghan air force pilots played a key role, alongside their U.S. counterparts, in the 20-year war against Taliban insurgents that ended with the departure of foreign troops in late August. 
The airstrikes inflicted heavy casualties among the Taliban and repeatedly drove them from positions they had seized in different parts of the country.
As the U.S.-backed Afghan government collapsed and the Taliban took over in mid-August, dozens of Afghan pilots fled to Central Asian countries, including Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. 
It's not clear how many military pilots and crew members remain in Afghanistan, what level of risk they face or to what extent Taliban assurances can be trusted. 
Over the past three months, there have been some reports of revenge killings by the Taliban, but not on a large, organized scale.
In a news conference Wednesday, Mujahid was asked about the most recent evacuation of pilots and crew members who, according to The New York Times, were flown to the United Arab Emirates. 
The military personnel had reportedly been in detention during their stay in Tajikistan.
Mujahid said Afghanistan needs pilots and that all is forgiven.
""My message is, there is no security problem for them (Afghan pilots) in Afghanistan, there is no plan of arresting them, national amnesty is announced,"" he said. 
He said the pilots, whether in the military or in civil aviation, ""can be at the service of their country."" 
""It is regrettable that a number of pilots have gone, or they are going,"" he added.
Separately, a spokesman for the Taliban intelligence service told the news conference that the agency has arrested close to 600 members of the militant Islamic State group in connection with violent attacks over the past three months.
The spokesman, Khalil Hamraz, said that among the detainees are key IS figures, including financial supporters.
At least 33 IS members have been killed in gunbattles with Taliban security forces, he said. 
He said several cars rigged with explosives and suicide vests were seized before they could be detonated.
Islamic State is an enemy of the Taliban. The two groups share a hard-line interpretation of Islam and over the years engaged in some of the same violent tactics, such as suicide bombings. 
However, the Taliban have focused on seizing control of Afghanistan, while IS adheres to global jihad.
In recent weeks, IS militants carried out a series of bombing and shooting attacks, trying to undercut a claim by the Taliban that they could restore security in Afghanistan.

STORYLINE:

An Islamic militant accused of masterminding last year's deadly nightclub bombings on Bali island entered a court on Wednesday to hear the final verdict in his trial.

Imam Samudra, an Afghan-trained fighter who has said he wants to die as a martyr, raised his fist defiantly as he entered the courtroom, crying ""God is Great"" four times.

The five-judge panel was expected to take several hours to read out the charges, witness statements and defence responses before giving its final verdict.

Samudra faces a possible death sentence under tough anti-terrorism laws passed after the October 12 nightclub attacks, which killed 202 people, mostly foreign tourists.

Prosecutors say Samudra, 33, commanded the group that carried out the attacks. He selected the recruits and helped fund the attacks, they say. 

Last month, his co-conspirator Amrozi bin Nurhasyim was sentenced to death for his role in the bombings. 

He was the first of more than 30 defendants arrested in the case to face justice.

A handful of foreign observers watched the court proceedings, including friends and relatives of victims caught in the twin blasts.

Security around the Denpasar courtroom was stepped up.

The Bali attack is blamed on Al-Qaida-linked Jemaah Islamiyah network said to operate throughout Southeast Asia. 

The network's commander, Riduan Isamuddin Hambali, was captured last month in Thailand and handed over to
U.S. custody.

Four astronauts returned to Earth on Monday, riding home with SpaceX to end a 200-day space station mission that began last spring.
  
Their capsule parachuted into the Gulf of Mexico off the coast of Pensacola, Florida, in darkness. Recovery boats quickly moved in with spotlights. 
  
Their homecoming - coming just eight hours after leaving the International Space Station - paved the way for SpaceX's launch of their four replacements as early as Wednesday night. 
  
The newcomers were scheduled to launch first, but NASA switched the order because of bad weather and an astronaut's undisclosed medical condition. The welcoming duties will now fall to the lone American and two Russians left behind at the space station.
  
Before Monday afternoon’s undocking, German astronaut Matthias Maurer, who’s waiting to launch at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center, tweeted it was a shame the two crews wouldn’t overlap at the space station but “we trust you’ll leave everything nice and tidy.” His will be SpaceX's fourth crew flight for NASA in just one-and-a-half years.
  
NASA astronauts Shane Kimbrough and Megan McArthur, Japan's Akihiko Hoshide and France's Thomas Pesquet should have been back Monday morning, but high wind in the recovery zone delayed their return.

8dmjQc0j1tw,sd,"(8 Nov 2021) LEAD IN:
A Polish veterinary student is using his entire university scholarship to develop a method for printing 3D, individually-fitted prostheses for lame dogs.
His first patient is 4-year-old Sonia, who was disabled in an accident at just eight months old.

STORY-LINE:
As a puppy Sonia was hit by a truck and lost part of her right hind leg.
Ever since she has been learning to walk with just three limbs, but it's affecting her posture and her owner Karolina Popecka is concerned for her future welfare.
Popecka and her dog are now looking forward to the future because Sonia is to be fitted with her new prosthesis.
She says: ""I'm counting on her being able to walk in this prosthesis because I would like her to take some of the weight off her hind leg. I can see she gets tired sometimes. She's not like regular dogs, she will not jump on the bed or run faster after a duck, right?""
The asymmetry left by her accident is having negative effects on Sonia's body.
""The prosthesis is needed to help her hips work the right way, because I can already see that the right leg, the one that's missing, goes down very much and the hip is also shifting right, too.  And this is not healthy for the dog, because when she gets older, her joints can simply fail,"" says Popecka.
Sonia is getting her new prosthesis thanks to this veterinary student in in Wroclaw.
Maciej Szczepanski is making individually fitted 3D printed prostheses for dogs in the same predicament as Sonia.
He believes the unequal distribution of weight on three legs of a dog causes the limbless joint to atrophy and people are wrong to believe animals can live normally despite losing a limb.
""Yes, there is this opinion that dogs can cope very well on three legs and they do manage, because, in fact, they have to manage somehow. But, in fact, there are many cases of degeneration if a dog distributes its weight on only three limbs and not on four, as it should be. So degeneration of joints occurs, restructuring of the muscles atrophy of muscles in the unused limb.  So the whole animal suffers,"" says Szczepanski.
He believes his devices are better suited for the needs of individual animals and, at up to 3,000 zlotys ($750) they are much cheaper than traditional endoprostheses which are attached surgically.
After making a mould of the dog's stump, Szczepanski takes a digital scan of it at his university's digitization centre. 
At home he has a 3D printer he uses to make the leg.
""My prostheses are, first of all, created individually for a specific animal, that's what makes them so good. Because they respond to the needs of a specific animal. They perfectly fit the stump, they are perfect in terms of size and their height is also adjustable, which is definitely a big advantage,"" says Szczepanski.
According to the student: ""(3D prostheses) are cheaper than endoprostheses, for example, due to the fact that this printing process is a relatively cheap method, it is also quite widely available and can be made quickly.""
Eventually he hopes to set up a business making the prostheses.
The lockdown during the pandemic gave him the time and opportunity to work out the smallest details of the process.
According to Szczepanski although the 3D printer method is used in other countries, it is still relatively new in Poland where he is based.
Sonia is getting a fitting with her prosthesis today, there's no knowing how long it will take before she is able to walk normally again, but Popecka is hopeful.

DSDn4EUboDc,sd,"(7 Nov 2021) The Taliban-run Afghan public health ministry has announced the start of a four-day nationwide polio vaccination campaign aimed at inoculating children under the age of 5.
For the past three years before taking control of Afghanistan, the Taliban had barred U.N.-organized vaccination teams from doing door-to-door campaigns in parts of the country under their control. 
The group apparently was suspicious the team members could be spies for the previous government or the West. 
Because of the ban and ongoing fighting, some 3.3 million children over the past three years have not been vaccinated. 
The Taliban's reported agreement now, after becoming the rulers of Afghanistan, appeared aimed at showing they are willing to cooperate with international agencies to re-open the door for international aid to rescue the crumbling economy
The Taliban made the announcement Sunday and the program begins Monday.

FaGNImKeg7E,sd,"(7 Nov 2021) US and Mexican parishes from the border city of Juarez on Saturday celebrated a mass for migrants who died attempting to cross the desert that separates the two countries. 
The mass was held as part of the Day of the Dead celebrations at El Punto, a shrine for migrants valued by locals as the point where Pope Francis paid tribute to those migrants. 
As many as 557 migrants have died so far this year on the border, according to human rights organizations. 
Marco Raposo, Minister of the Diocese of El Paso, Texas, said US policies contributed to the deaths as they pushed migrants away from cities and into the desert. 
In the religious tribute, an altar to the dead was set up, where photographs and belongings of migrants were placed. 
The mass was attended by a large number of migrants who now reside in Ciudad Juarez.

PxQ95RegAh4,sd,"(9 Nov 2021) nlike many of her European colleagues, Leonore Gewessler arrived Monday for this year's U.N. climate conference with a clean conscience.
Austria's environment minister and her entourage alighted at Glasgow Central Station having crossed half the continent in the time it takes some VIPs to circle the globe
""Wherever possible I try to choose the climate friendly option,"" said Gewessler.
Since taking office last year, the Green Party politician has pushed to revive Europe's once-extensive night train network, which has suffered heavy cuts due to competition from low-budget airlines.
Gewessler said she stopped over in Brussels to meet other European officials and used her 2,000-kilometer (1,240-mile) journey to prepare for the climate talks that are reaching their final phase this week.
""Trains and night trains are the future of short- and medium-distance travel in Europe,"" she said.
Gewessler also recently launched a nationwide 'climate ticket' that allows Austrians to travel the length and breadth of the Alpine nation on any form of public transport for 1,095 euros ($1,269) a year - or 3 euros ($3.50) a day.
Almost 130,000 people have bought a climate ticket in the last few weeks, beating the government's best expectations, she said.

RO5AlkT9OxM,sd,"(9 Nov 2021) FOR CLEAN VERSION SEE STORY NUMBER: 4352365

Now that eccentric real estate heir Robert Durst has been indicted for murder in the death of his first wife, who vanished nearly four decades ago, her family has some questions. Namely, what took so long?
Kathie Durst's brother, James McCormack, and a lawyer for her family held a press conference Tuesday to urge the suburban New York prosecutor who secured Durst's indictment to also investigate why he wasn't charged sooner.
In their first public comments since Durst's Nov. 1 indictment, McCormack and lawyer Robert Abrams outlined their concerns with the drawn-out criminal probe, including whether evidence was ignored and whether Durst's family wealth was an influence.
""Why did a series of district attorneys in Manhattan and Westchester County appear to decide to protect Robert Durst all of these years?,"" McCormack said. Why did former DA Jeanine Pirro commence an investigation only to abandon it at the last minute?""
In a letter Monday, Abrams requested that Westchester County District Attorney Mimi Rocah to ""acknowledge and correct the mistakes made by your predecessors"" and asked her to launch an investigation into what he said was an effort by Robert Durst's family and allies to hide Kathie Durst's killing.
Durst was indicted for Kathie Durst's death just weeks after he was sentenced in California to life in prison for killing a confidante who helped him cover up the slaying. Durst was hospitalized on a ventilator with COVID-19 after the Oct. 14 sentencing and has since been transferred to a state prison hospital.
Abrams said he would start releasing information next month that he said would expose people involved in the coverup. He accused former Westchester County District Attorney Jeanine Pirro, of punting the investigation after a private meeting with Robert Durst's brother, Douglas, in 2003.
Rocah's spokesperson declined comment.
A message for Pirro seeking comment was left with Fox News, where she hosts a weekly program, ""Justice with Judge Jeanine.""

ityZlzycfEM,sd,"(9 Nov 2021) Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya called on the European Union to be consistent in putting pressure on Lukashenko's regime, as tensions rise in migrant standoff at Poland-Belarus border.
During a three-day visit to Berlin she said: ""I want to only remind that we shouldn't look at migration crisis separately from the political crisis in Belarus because migration crisis is symptoms of the illness, core of the problem, and we don't have to shift the focus from human rights abuses in Belarus to the migration crisis because we understand that we may solve the migration crisis, you know, somehow, but without changing the regime we will not solve the whole problem.""
Poland reinforced its border with Belarus with more riot police on Tuesday, a day after groups of migrants tried to storm through a razor-wire fence on the eastern frontier where thousands have camped on the Belarusian side in the tense standoff.
The European Union accuses Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko of using the migrants as pawns in a ""hybrid attack"" against the bloc in retaliation for imposing sanctions on the authoritarian government for a brutal internal crackdown on dissent.
Thousands were jailed and beaten following months of protests after Lukashenko won a sixth term in a 2020 election that the opposition and the West saw as rigged.

They demanded that Saakashvili, who's on hunger strike, be transferred to a private clinic because he's getting weaker. 
The former president was jailed at the start of October on his return to Georgia, having been convicted in absentia of charges relating to abuses of power. 
While outside the country, he had been working to bolster opposition forces ahead of nationwide municipal elections.
Supporters contend that Saakashvili's health has seriously deteriorated while in prison.
But Georgian authorities say that his vital signs are normal, and that he's been consuming cereal and fruit juice. 
During Saturday's protest, opposition politician Khatia Dekanoidze - a former education minister - accused the government of violating Saakashvili's human rights by keeping him in the prison's medical wing.
Saakashvili's supporters have erected tents in front of the jail where he's being held, and have said they won't leave until he's been moved to a private hospital.

u_Lrrhqp17c,sd,"(6 Nov 2021) The once crystal-clear waters of River Katari, which springs from the glaciers in the Andes, are now a source of pollution and problems for the Aymara Indigenous communities and local authorities in the Bolivian town of Pucarani. 
A recent cleaning campaign involving soldiers and Indigenous farmers from the surrounding communities fell short of clearing the river of plastic waste, just one part of the pollutants. 
The task proved to be bigger than expected. 
Juan Carlos Lopez, the Environmental and Water Secretary of Pucarani Municipality said the water of River Katari was ""practically acidic.""
""It's practically non-drinkable. From what we've seen, the mercury is high, and it also contains a lot of sediment.""
According to municipal authorities, the native vegetation that once filled the area and served as forage for their livestock has long been depleted by pollution. 
Indigenous farmers from the area have expressed their concerns over the situation and are demanding the government to act to stop the pollution.
On Friday, Mauricio Flores, one of the Indigenous farmers with communal access to the lands, described his fears for their livestock and crops.
""We are asking for it (pollution) to stop. We want clear water,"" said Flores.
Josue Gonzales, an expert in water management with the Bolivian Ministry of Environment, said pollutants enter the river as its multiple branches cross through various municipalities, with industries and huge populations. 
Gonzales said over a million people live and deliver waste to the river. 
The water of the Katari River with all the waste and pollutants ends up in Lake Titicaca, shared by Bolivia and Peru.  
In 2015 Bolivia lost its second-largest lake, the Poopó, to an extended drought.

VVZaI1Zwdtw,sd,"(9 Nov 2021) UK PUBLISHER BEGINS APPEAL OVER MEGHAN PRIVACY LAWSUIT
A British newspaper publisher on Tuesday (9 NOVEMBER 2021) began its court appeal against a judge's ruling that it invaded the privacy of the Duchess of Sussex by publishing parts of a letter she wrote to her estranged father, arguing that she knew the letter would potentially be published. 
Publisher Associated Newspapers is fighting back against Meghan Markle, 40, who sued it for invasion of privacy and copyright infringement over five February 2019 articles in the Mail on Sunday and on the MailOnline website that reproduced large portions of a letter she wrote to her father, Thomas Markle. The letter was written after the American's 2018 marriage to Prince Harry.
A High Court judge sided with Markle in February, ruling that the paper's publication of the letter was “manifestly excessive and hence unlawful.” 
On Tuesday, lawyer Andrew Caldecott countered that the letter was not written as an “intimate communication for her father's eyes only.”
“The letter was crafted specifically with the potential of public consumption in mind because the claimant appreciated Mr. Markle might disclose it to the media,” the lawyer told the Court of Appeal.
The publisher was ordered in March to print a front-page statement stating it had infringed the duchess's copyright, but the statement has not been published pending the outcome of the appeal. 
Three senior judges preside over the appeal, which is expected to last three days. A ruling is due at a later date. 
Meghan, a former star of the American TV legal drama “Suits,” married Harry, a grandson of Queen Elizabeth II, at Windsor Castle in May 2018. 
Meghan and Harry announced in early 2020 that they were quitting royal duties and moving to North America, citing what they said were the unbearable intrusions and racist attitudes of the British media.

YuUjyWmGQNM,sd,"(9 Nov 2021) About 800 bodies are waiting to be buried or cremated in the largest cemetery in the Sicilian city of Palermo.
Hundreds of coffins are piled one on top of the other in a storage room, others in two tents outdoors, exposed to the elements.
Distressed relatives tell of having to climb over other coffins to reach the coffins of their loved ones. 
""There are some coffins, close to that of my father, which give off a bad smell and are opening,"" said one Palermo resident who had come to leave flowers on his father's coffin.
Sometimes the stench is so strong that it's impossible to enter the makeshift storage area, even for a quick prayer. 
Every day more coffins arrive at the Santa Mari dei Rotol"" cemetery, but there are no spaces available, either among the niches or in the ground.
In any case cremations are impossible - the crematorium has been out of service for more than a year.  
There have been capacity issues at the cemetery since the 1980s, but over the years plans to solve the situation have either been abandoned midway, or never got off the ground. 
According to a city councilman, Igor Gelarda, the responsibility falls on the municipal administrations of the last 40 years, which have not expanded the cemetery.
He said plans to open a new crematorium there had to be abandoned after the project designers failed to include a sewage system in the plans.
He says the only solution is to build a new cemetery.

vuHaKXRa9Kg,sd,"(10 Nov 2021) LEAD IN: 
The receding water levels in the reservoir of Dohuk Dam in northern Iraq have revealed an old village the dam was built on some 40 years ago.

STORY-LINE: 
The record low water levels in Dohuk Dam's reservoir, in northern Iraq, has revealed a village that the dam was built on 40 years ago. 
Qasri village was one of several villages that were submerged under water during the construction of Dohuk Dam from 1980 to 1988.  
Remains of the buildings in the village showed up this year because of the significant receding of water in reservoir. 
Scarcity of rainfall this year has caused severe drought in the region. 
Dohuk Dam was built mainly to provide drinking and irrigation water for the city of Dohuk. 
Its main sources are rainwater and small water streams formed by melting snow. 
The reservoir has a capacity to store 52 million cubic meter (about 1.8 billion cubic foot) of water. 
But this season ""there is 20 million cubic meter (7.06 million cubic foot) of water in it, compared to 34 million cubic meter (1.2 billion cubic foot) of water at the same time of last year,"" said the director of the dam, Farhad Mohammed.

Thousands of Yemenis flee amid continued fighting between Iran-backed rebels and forces loyal to Yemen's internationally recognized government.

STORY-LINE:
Yemenis continued fleeing the fighting near the city of Marib between Iran-backed rebels and forces loyal to Yemen's internationally recognized government.
Around 3,000 families, or nearly 17,000 individuals, have fled the Rawdat Jehm camp near the Marib Dam and arrived at the newly set up Al-Sima camp in Marib's Al-Wadi district, according to one camp official.
Many have fled more than once, traveling long distances with their belongings.
""When this new fighting started, we fled again. And here we are in this tent with eight children,"" said Mohammed Showi, who was setting up a tent at Al-Sima camp.
""The situation is deplorable. There's lack of all the basic needs, including water and water distribution points, shelters, food and sanitation,"" said the headman of the camp, Mohsen al-Suri.
Last week, security officials said at least 200 fighters were killed in clashes between Yemen's government forces and Houthi rebels in and around the strategic central province of Marib over two days.
Most of the casualties belonged to the Houthi forces, who have recently wrestled from their rivals most of Marib's 14 districts, according to the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to brief the media.
The Houthis have for years attempted to take oil-rich Marib to complete their control over the northern half of Yemen.
The Iran-backed Shiite Houthis have stepped up their push in the oil-rich province in recent weeks, while also escalating cross-border attacks on Saudi Arabia.
The kingdom is leading a military coalition that has been fighting on the government side against the Houthis since 2015.
Yemen has been convulsed by civil war since 2014 when the Houthis captured the capital, Sanaa, and much of the north of the country, forcing the internationally recognized government to flee to the south, then to Saudi Arabia.
Despite a relentless air campaign and ground fighting, the war has deteriorated largely into a stalemate and spawned the world's worst humanitarian crisis.

Hd_QE775hl8,sd,"(9 Nov 2021) Livestock ranchers in Argentina, one of the world's top meat exporters, have been pushed to join the reduction of emissions to limit global warming.
Feedlot producers have started to look into the problem of methane emission, while environmentalists warn that it won't be enough without a change in consumption patterns.
As part of their digestion, cattle release methane, a potent greenhouse gas that worsens climate change.
In order to limit the temperature rising to a maximum of 1.5-2 degrees, as set by the Paris Climate Agreement, researchers worldwide agree the livestock industry should reduce its emissions drastically.
Total emissions from global livestock per year represent 14.5 percent of all anthropogenic greenhouse emissions, and 44 percent of livestock emissions are in the form of methane, according to the UN Food and Agricultural Organization.
To curb emissions, food companies have developed some additives.  In September, Chile and Brazil started using one of these supplements for livestock food, aiming to reduce methane emissions by 30 percent.
In Argentina, feedlots are just beginning to look into the problem.
Fernando Storni, General Manager of the Argentine Feedlot Chamber, acknowledged the problem and warned that in the near future commercial agreements could include certain greenhouse certifications for producers.
Guillermo del Barrio, owner of El Trébol feedlot, with some 10,000 head of cattle tightly packed in various corrals, said he sees some change is coming.
However, Walter Pengue, agricultural engineer and ecology professor at General Sarmiento National University, said the feed additives and other technologies to reduce emissions are not enough.
""The consumption patterns must be changed,"" he said. ""We need to look at what's behind the meat, that is the soil that is rapidly degrading, there is the water, which is in a tremendously serious limit.""
Argentina has some 53 million head of livestock, of which almost 14 million is slaughter cattle, according to Argentina's Agriculture, Cattle raising and Fishing Ministry.

d0lCcwTb1HA,sd,"(10 Nov 2021) After the long-awaited reopening of the border between Mexico and the United States, the hopes of many migrants camped close to the crossing at Tijuana are still waiting to be realised.
More than 1,200 people remain in a makeshift camp at the border, wishing to be able to cross into southern California.
The land crossing reopened on Monday after more than 19 months of restrictions due to the coronavirus pandemic.
Mayra Gutiérrez has been in the camp for six months with her 10-year-old daughter after they fled violence from her home in Lazaro Cardenas in Michoacan state.
""We're all looking forward to making it to the United States. That is the only thought we have,"" she said. ""Everyone is sad and desperate. That's what we feel here.""
Flor Deli Mejía Zamora, 29 and a mother of six, fled Guerrero because of violence and the harassment of her teenage daughters.
""We all had hopes that when they opened (the border) they were going to also open up asylum opportunities,"" she said. ""But they haven't told us anything.""
Jose Maria Garcia Lara, the coordinator of the Tijuana Migrant Alliance, estimates some 3,000 people are waiting in the city for the chance to present their asylum case.
""They have faith that at any moment there could be again that openness for the aid that the U.S. government was providing to the people seeking asylum or humanitarian aid,"" Garcia Lara said.

Vu9hS9JHZTo,sd,"(10 Nov 2021) German Chancellor Angela Merkel asked Russian President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday to intervene with Minsk over the escalating migrant situation on Belarus' border with Poland.
Groups of migrants made bold attempts this week to cross into European Union territory, which the bloc alleges has been enabled by Belarusian authorities.
The chancellor's spokesman Steffen Seibert said Merkel spoke with Putin by phone and underlined the exploitation of migrants by Belarusian authorities was  ""inhuman"" and ""completely unacceptable."" 
Merkel asked the Russian president ""to exert his influence on the regime in Minsk,"" Seibert said.
Russia is a close ally of the government in Belarus. 
Germany is a favoured destination for migrants who manage to enter the EU.
The readout of the call released by the Kremlin said Putin ""proposed to establish a discussion of the problems that have arisen in direct contacts of representatives of the EU member states with Minsk."" 
It also said that Putin and Merkel ""agreed to continue the conversation on the issue."". 
Poland's Defence Ministry and local police reported Wednesday that multiple groups of migrants tried to enter the country late Tuesday and early Wednesday but that all the people who made it were detained. 
Hundreds of migrants have been camping since Monday on the Belarus side of the border, across from the Polish village of Kuznica. 
EU leaders accuse the regime of Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko of opening up a new migration route to Europe to create instability in retaliation for sanctions the bloc imposed on Lukashenko's authoritarian government. 
The EU imposed the sanctions over a brutal crackdown on domestic dissent following Lukashenko's disputed election to a sixth term in August 2020.

M0ZY8mM3vY4,sd,"(9 Nov 2021) Four astronauts returned to Earth on Monday, riding home with SpaceX to end a 200-day space station mission that began last spring.
  
Their capsule parachuted into the Gulf of Mexico off the coast of Pensacola, Florida, in darkness. Recovery boats quickly moved in with spotlights. 
  
Their homecoming - coming just eight hours after leaving the International Space Station - paved the way for SpaceX's launch of their four replacements as early as Wednesday night. 
  
The newcomers were scheduled to launch first, but NASA switched the order because of bad weather and an astronaut's undisclosed medical condition. The welcoming duties will now fall to the lone American and two Russians left behind at the space station.
  
Before Monday afternoon’s undocking, German astronaut Matthias Maurer, who’s waiting to launch at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center, tweeted it was a shame the two crews wouldn’t overlap at the space station but “we trust you’ll leave everything nice and tidy.” His will be SpaceX's fourth crew flight for NASA in just one-and-a-half years.
  
NASA astronauts Shane Kimbrough and Megan McArthur, Japan's Akihiko Hoshide and France's Thomas Pesquet should have been back Monday morning, but high wind in the recovery zone delayed their return.

4tURrF6bLf4,sd,"(8 Nov 2021) A tourist bus carrying humanitarian aid left Berlin on Monday bound for the border region between Poland and Belarus, following reports that a large group of migrants in Belarus was heading for a crossing point.
German humanitarian organisations Seebrücke Deutschland (SeaBridge Germany) and LeaveNoOneBehind organised boxes of supplies, including winter clothes and medical aid, to be sent to the border area to support the work of local Polish movements and NGOs. 
The groups say also they want to bring back a number of migrants to Germany but that the German government has not so far authorised such a move.    
""But it would be also an opportunity for Angela Merkel to set a humanitarian signal at the end of her time in government,"" said Tareq Alaows, an activist with Seebrücke Deutschland (SeaBridge Germany).
Poland is stepping up security at its border with Belarus, on the European Union's eastern border, officials said Monday.
Polish Defence Minister, Mariusz Blaszczak, said on Twitter that that more than 12,000 soldiers have been deployed on the border, up from the 10,000 soldiers that were there recently. 
He added that a volunteer Territorial Defence force was put on alert.
Since the summer, Poland has been under increasing pressure of migrants from the Middle East and Africa trying to cross into the EU. 
Poland is blocking these attempts or sending those who cross back into Belarus. 
Warsaw and the EU say it's an organised action by the Belarusian government aimed at destabilising the bloc in retaliation for Western sanctions. 
""The Belarusian regime acts as a trafficker. It is 'instrumentalising' refugees and migrants in a politically and humanely reprehensible way,"" Steffen Seibert, German Chancellor Angela Merkel's spokesman, said on Monday.
Poland's Border Guard has reported incidents of hostile behavior and threats by Belarusian forces directed across the border at Polish forces.

Hg9cauKsMwE,sd,"(7 Nov 2021) Security has been ramped up in Baghdad following the failed assassination attempt on the Iraqi prime minister on Sunday.
In a statement, the government said an explosives-laden drone tried to hit Mustafa al-Kadhimi’s home. 
Residents of Baghdad heard the sound of an explosion followed by heavy gunfire from the direction of the Green Zone, which houses foreign embassies and government offices.
More troops have been deployed in the wake of the drone attack.
Baghdad locals condemned the attack suggesting it could destabilise the political situation within the country. 
""We, as the Iraqi people, completely reject this attack,"" said one local. 
The Iraqi government confirmed al-Kadhimi had survived the assassination attempt  and is unharmed.
Two Iraqi officials told The Associated Press that seven of al-Kadhimi's security guards were injured in the attack by two armed drones which occurred in Baghdad's heavily fortified Green Zone area. 
They spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to give official statements.
The PM later appeared on Iraqi television, seated behind a desk in a white shirt, looking calm and composed. 
There was no immediate claim for the attack. 
It comes amid a stand-off between security forces and pro-Iran Shiite militias whose supporters have been camped outside the Green Zone for nearly a month after they rejected the results of Iraq’s parliamentary elections in which they lost around two-thirds of their seats.

STORYLINE: 

Security was tight around a courthouse in Indonesia on Thursday where a verdict is expected in the trial of Amrozi bin Nurhasyim, a key suspect for last October's Bali bombings. 

Amrozi faces a possible death sentence.

Last year's twin nightclub blasts in Bali, a tourist hotspot, killed 202 people, mostly foreign tourists. 

Amrozi is among more than 30 people accused of being involved in the attack, but his will be the first verdict. 

Amrozi was dubbed the ""Smiling Bomber"" after he appeared giggling before TV crews after his arrest.

The suspect smiled and joked his way through three months of court hearings, to the upset of survivors, relatives of the victims and many Indonesians.

Only last Monday, he angered judges when he glibly claimed not to know his younger brother, Ali Imron, who is also accused in the attack.

And on Wednesday, he told judges: ""I don't think I need to say anything because tomorrow I need to be sentenced anyway.""

Anything less than life imprisonment will likely be met with outrage, especially in Australia, home to 88 of the victims, and could raise questions about the ability of Indonesia's legal system to tackle Islamic militancy.

Amrozi's trial, which began in May, has been quicker than predicted.

The baby-faced 41-year-old former repairman has admitted in court to buying the minivan used in the attack and driving it to Bali. 

Judges have also seen forensic evidence allegedly linking him to the vehicle.

His lawyers say that Amrozi had nothing to do with the planning of the attack - something they hope will mean he can escape the death penalty. 

The blasts have been blamed on Jemaah Islamiyah, an al-Qaida linked Southeast Asian terror group that allegedly wants to set up a regional Islamic state.

On Thursday, journalists and cameramen queueing to enter Nari Graha Court in Denpasar, the provincial capital of Bali, had their equipment thoroughly searched by the police. 

On Wednesday, Indonesian police revealed that they carried out a raid last month that netted seven alleged members of Jemaah Islamiyah. 

Police said they seized documents showing terrorists were planning to target the area around Jakarta's
Marriott Hotel, where a powerful car bomb this week killed at least 10 people and injured nearly 150. 

The revelation came as Indonesian and Australian authorities warned that more terror strikes were possible in Indonesia in the coming days. 

Jemaah Islamiyah is a shadowy group said to be fighting to install a pan-Islamic state in Southeast Asia.

Hundreds of activists gathered in front of Paris City Hall Saturday to protest against what they called climate inaction by the world's top ten polluting nations.
They displayed large banners carrying images of world leaders including the French, U.S. and Chinese presidents, alongside one reading ""Climate inaction = crime against life.""
The protest in the French capital was one of several demonstrations across the world marking the Global Day of Action for Climate Justice, as negotiations continue at the U.N. climate summit in Glasgow.
Inside the conference venue Saturday, negotiators knuckled down for a seventh day of talks to finish draft agreements that can be passed to ministers for political approval next week.
Among the issues being haggled over at the talks by almost 200 countries are a fresh commitment to the goal of capping global warming at 1.5 degrees Celsius, getting countries to review their efforts more frequently, and financial support for poor nations.

British Airways and Virgin Atlantic jets took-off simultaneously from London Heathrow on Monday bound for the U.S. as the coronavirus travel ban was lifted between the two nations.
The rival airlines departed at approximately 0850 GMT for New York's JFK airport.
Foreign travellers flying to the U.S. are required to demonstrate proof of vaccination before boarding, as well as proof of a negative COVID-19 test taken within three days of flight.

QqJfkXyf6ZY,hd,"Thousands gathered in Warsaw on Thursday for an annual Independence Day march carrying Polish and nationalist group flags, an event the far-right organizers dedicated to uniformed ""protectors of the border"" amid an escalating migrant crisis at the country's eastern border.

Warsaw authorities had secured a court ban on the event that runs separately from official celebrations and has a history of occasional violence, but Poland's nationalist administration helped challenge the ban.

Marchers, including families with children but also representatives of nationalist groups like National Radical Camp (ONR), fired red flares and chanted ""Viva, viva border guard"" and ""God, Honour, Homeland"" as they walked through Warsaw.

March leaders warned against what they said were Western attempts to turn Poles into ""pariahs,"" and condemned liberal Western political and cultural influences.

Critics say in lending its hand, the Law and Justice government is giving overt support to the far-right and fomenting anti-migrant sentiment at a time when Poland faces unprecedented pressure from thousands of migrants trying to cross into the European Union via its border with Belarus.

The European Union accuses Minsk of manufacturing the crisis in revenge for earlier sanctions by helping people fleeing conflict-torn regions make it to Belarus and then try to cross into Poland and its other EU neighbours.

Prosecutors say former Las Vegas Raiders wide receiver Henry Ruggs III is facing upwards of 50 years in prison for a fatal crash that killed a 23-year-old woman in Las Vegas on Nov. 2. 

Ruggs, who did not appear in court for his arraignment Wednesday morning, was formally charged with five counts in a fiery crash that claimed the life of Tina Tintor and her dog Max. 

Prosecutors say Ruggs' blood-alcohol content was twice the legal limit, and he was speeding at 156 miles per hour in the early hours of Nov. 2 when his Corvette slammed into the back end of a Toyota Rav4 driven by Tintor. The Rav4 burst into flames and Tintor and her dog were trapped inside. 

Ruggs and his girlfriend Rudy Washington, who have a 1-year-old daughter together, were both injured in the crash as well.

Global's Steve Autio provides more details on the charges.

Plus, the Belarusian State Border Committee has released a video on Sunday showing a group of people caught between barbed wire fencings, guarded by unidentified servicemen.

According to the committee's statement, migrants had become stuck in the fences at the checkpoint Kuznitsa on the Polish side.

Thousands of migrants have travelled to Belarus with the hope of crossing into the European Union, only to find themselves trapped at the border in freezing conditions.

D5YxQqSWITw,hd,"Cpl. Francis Pegahmagabow, known as ""Peggy,""  is the most decorated Indigenous soldier in Canadian history and the deadliest sniper of World War One.

A hundred years ago, when Indigenous people weren’t allowed to volunteer to fight in the war, Canadian Forces began to suffer significant losses and only then was Pegahmagabow to enlist. 

Over the next four years, he fought in the most horrific battles of the war, including Passchendaele, Somme and the second battle of Ypres when the Germans used chlorine gas. 

“He won the military medal three times, and is one of 38 Canadians to ever do this and those are awarded by the Battalion Brigade Commander,” notes author and historian Timothy Winegard.

 So how is it that Pegahmagabow’s exploits are not taught in Canadian history?

Mike Drolet reports.

-vIAxdFIoa8,hd,"Tens of thousands of people took to the streets in the Sudanese capital Khartoum on Saturday to protest against a military takeover, despite security forces firing tear gas and bullets to disperse them.

As protesters began to gather in the early afternoon around the capital, security forces moved quickly to try to disperse them, firing tear gas and chasing demonstrators down side streets to try to prevent them reaching central meeting points, witnesses said.

Two more protesters have been killed during demonstrations against military rule in Sudan, the Central Committee of Sudanese Doctors said, after reporting one death earlier in the day.

The demonstrations come two days after military leader Abdel Fattah al-Burhan announced the formation of a new ruling council that excludes the civilian coalition the military had been sharing power with since 2019.

Sudanese pro-democracy groups condemned the move and vowed to continue their campaign of civil disobedience and protests against the Oct. 25 coup.

Global News has exclusive video of a couple of recent driveway thefts that show just how quickly locked cars could be opened, started and stolen. 

In one case, a Toronto man shows us exclusive video of a thief making off with his expensive Range Rover in a matter of seconds. We've called him ""Max"" in order to protect the man from possible retaliation from the alleged thieves.

And he's not the only one - increasingly, the owners of fine cars are starting to wonder just how secure these expensive investments are, and why it's so easy in some cases to steal these supposedly-secure automobiles.

OjKkEL75lRE,hd,"An explosive device that blew up a taxi in Liverpool on Sunday was carried on board by a passenger and the blast is being treated as a “terrorist incident,” police said Monday.

The taxi exploded outside Liverpool Women's Hospital, killing the passenger and injuring the driver, who received medical treatment but has since been released from hospital.

Assistant Chief Const. Russ Jackson of Counter-Terrorism Policing Northwest said they believed they knew the identity of the passenger who was killed by the explosion, but could not disclose it.

Three men aged 29, 26 and 21 were arrested on Sunday, and Jackson said another 20-year-old man had been arrested Monday.

British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is expected to hold a meeting of the government's emergency committee on Monday to discuss the explosion.

Mike Le Couteur reports on the commemorations, as well as a smaller ceremony held for Indigenous veterans that received more attention this year. 

The solemn day also comes as the Canadian Armed Forces reckons with multiple sexual misconduct allegations involving senior leaders, and the Taliban takeover this past summer of Afghanistan. Mercedes Stephenson looks at how veterans are reflecting on a difficult year.

As the European Union blames Belarus for the migrant crisis at the country's border with Poland, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko is issuing a new threat. As Crystal Goomansingh reports, Lukashenko says sanctions better not be slapped on his country - or else.

In the United States, Kyle Rittenhouse, the 18-year-old on trial for fatally shooting two men and wounding a third during racial injustice protests in Kenosha, Wis. in August 2020, says he was just trying to defend himself. Jackson Proskow explains why the case has divided Americans, and how Judge Bruce Schroeder, who's presiding over the trial, is also causing controversy.

Cpl. Francis Pegahmagabow, known as ""Peggy,"" is the most decorated Indigenous soldier in Canadian history and the deadliest sniper of World War One, winning the military medal three times. So how is it that Pegahmagabow's exploits are not taught in Canadian history? Mike Drolet has his story.

And 10 years after its inception, the No Stone Left Alone initiative marked another Remembrance Day, with students from across Canada placing poppies on the graves of soldiers. It's a simple but important and meaningful gesture. Ross Lord looks at how a newer generation is connecting with the sacrifices of the past.

tC034CDh1A4,hd,"Kevin Gough, the defence attorney for one of the three men charged in the death of Ahmaud Arbery, sought to have Rev. Jesse Jackson expelled from the courtroom during the trial on Monday, on the grounds it could prejudice the jury. 

“At this point, I’m not exactly sure what you’re doing,” Judge Timothy Walmsley said in response to the motion.”

Walmsley also admonished Gough for comments made last week, which the judge called “reprehensible.”

Last week, Gough sought to have Rev. Al Sharpton removed from court. While delivering his motion, he made the comment “we don’t want any more Black pastors coming in here.”

“If a bunch of folks came in here dressed like Colonel Sanders with white masks sitting in the back, I mean, that would be…,” he continued before being cut off by Judge Walmsley.

On Monday, Walmsley called the comments “reprehensible” and suggested they may have gone so far as to “influence what is going on here.”

A stampede of fans during rap star Travis Scott's Astroworld Festival last Friday killed nine people between the ages of 14 and 27 and injured scores.

""They went to the concert, expected it to be safe, not expecting it to be deadly and they are shaken and they keep having these nightmares,"" Attorney Ben Crump announced at a news conference in Houston.

The filing of the latest 90 cases follows at least 50 other suits have been brought against producer Live Nation Entertainment Inc and Scott over the deaths and injuries related to the concert.

Crump said any one of several concert officials could have prevented deaths and injuries by stopping the show and turning on the house lights when the chaos in the crowd became apparent.

TEZcEiW-nc0,hd,"The European Union (EU) will bring further sanctions, including against some airlines, to combat Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko’s “perfidious” use of migrants, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen announced Monday.

EU foreign ministers are meeting in Brussels to determine what those sanctions will look like.

“This is the attempt of an autocratic regime to manipulate people who they lured into a trap under false promises to destabilize its democratic neighbours. That won’t happen,” von der Leyen said.

Belarus has denied it is driving the ongoing migrant crisis at its border with Poland. Polish border guards have reported 5,100 attempted irregular crossings so far in November, compared to 120 in all of 2020.

khfpq0kkBS0,hd,"Federal officials including Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, dignitaries and veterans commemorated the sacrifices of Canadian war dead and veterans on Thursday at a Remembrance ceremony marking the anniversary of the end of the Second World War.
 
Remembrance Day in Ottawa saw the return of crowds gathered at the National War Memorial after a year of virtual observances amid the COVID-19 pandemic.
 
Thursday’s ceremony was out of order in the traditional sense, where the national anthem and Last Post, which traditionally signals the two minutes of silence, did not happen until after the two minutes. The Prime Minister and Governor General Mary Simon both arrived later than originally planned.
 
According to a statement provided to Global News from Veterans’ Affairs Canada, the delay in the arrival of the Prime Minister and Governor General was caused by a potential security risk.

Two minutes of silence was observed to remember the sacrifices of Canadian military members at 11 a.m. ET.

hT9yo1qZM5o,hd,"As COP26 nears its end, a draft agreement is setting the stage for the last-minute negotiations underway between 200 participating countries. Crystal Goomansingh reports on how the plan is being criticized and how two of the planet's biggest polluters have now issued their own pledges.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador are set to meet with U.S. President Joe Biden at the White House on November 18. Jackson Proskow looks at what's expected to be on the agenda for the North American Leaders' Summit, which is being dubbed the ""Three Amigos"" summit.

Plus, the pandemic forced thousands of surgeries to be delayed in Alberta and Saskatchewan. With COVID-19 cases declining in both provinces, some patients still haven't undergone vital procedures. Heather Yourex-West looks at how much longer they may have to wait.

Meanwhile, the man accused of running down and killing a Muslim family in London, Ontario in June may have been inspired by the gunman who killed 51 people at two New Zealand mosques in 2019. In a Global News exclusive, Mike Drolet reports on what was apparently found in the accused's home, truck, and computer.

Canada's Punjabi soldiers played a prominent role throughout the First World War. But their contributions aren't well known. As Neetu Garcha reports, one historian is pushing to get their sacrifices some long overdue recognition.

And in the final weeks of the First World War, Canadian aviator Lt. James Gordon Moore was horribly burned trying to save his co-pilot after a plane crash. He spent his final months in a British hospital, where his sister visited and she sent a letter home. As Redmond Shannon explains, that letter is now helping his family bring his story to life.

The Kyle Rittenhouse trial was in jeopardy on Wednesday after the teen's defence lawyers asked for a mistrial over what they argued were out-of-bounds questions asked of him by the chief prosecutor. These questions included the 18-year-old's silence after his arrest, which also prompted the judge to issue a sharp rebuke of the prosecutor.

Judge Bruce Schroeder said he would consider the request, but allowed cross-examination by prosecutor Thomas Binger to continue into the evening.

During Rittenhouse's testimony, he broke down and at one point appeared to hyperventilate as he described being under attack when he killed two men and wounded a third with his rifle. The shootings occurred during a night of protests in Kenosha, Wis. on Aug. 25, 2020, as people demonstrated in response to the shooting of Jacob Blake.

As Sean Previl reports, the defence is set to continue questioning its witnesses and experts Thursday with closing arguments expected as soon as Monday.

Canada is particularly concerned about proposed U.S. electric vehicle tax credits for American-built vehicles, which Ottawa says would hurt the integrated continental auto industry and put thousands of jobs at risk.

Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is set to bring up the tax credits issue when he meets with U.S. President Joe Biden and Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador next week at the so-called Three Amigos summit.

r0im3i6TN14,hd,"As people came together Thursday to honour veterans, some events in B.C. were marred by protests in opposition to COVID-19 health measures and vaccinations. 

In Kelowna, as a Remembrance Day ceremony concluded, a woman set up a microphone to speak about COVID-19 restrictions, prompting incensed veterans to challenge her. And in Kamloops, anti-vaccine protesters gathered at the Old Cenotaph, where some residents attended without realizing the purpose of the gathering. 

As Catherine Urquhart reports, the protests in both communities, as well as graffiti that defaced a memorial in Cranbrook with words in green paint “the real heroes are the vaccinated,” have left residents angered over what they say is disrespectful of what the day stands for.

""I apologize for the way this process has unfolded and I’m deeply sorry,” COP26 President Alok Sharma said. The change weakens the language on the use of coal in the efforts to cut emissions. Redmond Shannon has more. 

The climate crisis will also be on the agenda next week in Washington, when Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau meets with U.S. President Joe Biden and Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador. The leaders will attend the first ""Three Amigos"" summit since 2016. Mercedes Stephenson has been talking to Canada’s ambassador in Washington about the issues. 

COVID-19 cases are once again rising in some provinces, leaving officials to consider their next steps to limit the spread. But the concern is highest in Yukon, which has become Canada’s new COVID-19 hotspot. Abigail Bimman reports. 

In the U.S., 47 million Americans have been infected with the virus: that’s nearly 15 per cent of the population. New cases are increasing by about a million people every two weeks. And at least 14 states are reporting an uptick in hospitalizations. With American Thanksgiving approaching, medical experts say the situation could get worse. Jennifer Johnson reports. 

A powerful gang leader in Haiti says he will lift a month long blockade of fuel terminals that has cut off gas supplies and made everyday life on the island nation even more difficult. The country has endured a year of back-to-back crisis – the assassination of its president, a powerful earthquake and a string of kidnappings. And as the turmoil worsens, the Canadian and U.S. governments have urged all of their citizens to leave. Some Canadians living in Haiti plan to stay put, but say Ottawa needs to do more to help the country. Kamil Karamali reports.

XdhigQd9ZbI,hd,"As the dust settles on the COP26 climate summit, how it went depends on whom you ask. A deal may have been struck - but an 11th hour edit to soften the language around coal is causing concern among developing nations more vulnerable to the effects of global warming. But Canada is championing the deal as a ground breaking success. Abigail Bimman reports.
 
There’s another piece to the climate change puzzle that Canada must confront. Warmer temperatures in the Arctic are thawing permafrost - which accounts for 40 per cent of Canada's surface. And that big melt is releasing carbon that has been locked away for centuries. Not only that, life is being disrupted in these remote northern communities. Eric Sorensen explains. 
 
New lockdowns are being imposed in parts of Europe that are once again the epicentre of COVID-19. In Austria the measures are stringent, targeting the unvaccinated. And that has led to protests. But as Jennifer Johnson explains, the situation in Europe may serve as a warning for North America. 
 
The Biden administration in Washington has voiced support for Poland in its ongoing border standoff with Belarus. It comes as the Polish government considers asking NATO to hold emergency talks over the escalating situation. Caught in the middle, thousands of cold, hungry migrants are growing more desperate by the day. Critics say they are being taken advantage of in what essentially amounts to a propaganda war. Redmond Shannon reports. 
 
In just over a week the 44th Parliament of Canada will begin. And it will be the first to include a minister of mental health and addictions. It’s a significant step - but the government has released few details about the new ministry. And as David Akin explains, an all-party group of MPs is encouraging parliamentarians to make sure they focus on the mental health of Canadians and their own. 
 
Endometriosis is an extremely painful gynecological disorder affecting more than half a million women in Canada. But experts believe that number is much larger. Thousands of patients are being misdiagnosed and even worse ignored. As Jamie Maraucher reports, doctors at one Toronto hospital are sounding the alarm on what the call a substandard quality of care.

EJ9FzH1PJsY,hd,"NASA and Elon Musk's SpaceX launched four more astronauts on a flight to the International Space Station (ISS) late Wednesday, including a veteran spacewalker, a German materials scientist and two younger crewmates chosen to join NASA's forthcoming lunar missions.

The SpaceX-built launch vehicle, consisting of a Crew Dragon capsule perched atop a two-stage Falcon 9 rocket, climbed into the night sky from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida around 9 p.m.

Armed with cameras, crowds gathered to watch the launch at Space View Park in Titusville, Fla., and were heard marvelling at the sight of the rocket creating a bright fireball as it took off.

The three American astronauts and their European Space Agency crewmate were due to arrive at the space station on Thursday evening following a flight of about 22 hours.

The flight marks the third ""operational"" space station crew sent to orbit aboard a Dragon capsule since NASA and SpaceX teamed up to resume space launches from American soil last year, following a nine-year hiatus at the end of the U.S. space shuttle program in 2011.

Belarusian authorities say more than 2,000 migrants have gathered at the border and have blamed the European Union for the crisis. Belarus and Russia say that by blocking the migrants’ passing, Poland and the EU – of which Poland is a member – have not lived up to their humanitarian values. 

Migrants from the Middle East, Afghanistan and Africa made multiple attempts to force their way into Poland overnight on Wednesday, Warsaw says, announcing that it has reinforced its border to prevent their entry.

The European Union accuses Belarus of encouraging the migrants to try to illegally cross the border in revenge for sanctions imposed on Minsk over human rights abuses.

The explosion took place outside the Liverpool Women’s Hospital, just before a Remembrance Day service at the nearby Liverpool Cathedral.

kiKagcuJPT4,hd,"Austria is placing millions of people not fully vaccinated against the coronavirus in lockdown as of Monday to deal with a surge in infections to record levels, Chancellor Alexander Schallenberg said on Sunday.

""The incidence within vaccinated people is declining, but it continues to rise exponentially for the people who are not vaccinated,"" Schallenberg told reporters.

""Currently, the incidence for unvaccinated people in the 18-59 age group is over 1,700, so today we have decided that from tomorrow there will be a lockdown for the unvaccinated in Austria,"" he added.

Europe has become the epicentre of the COVID-19 pandemic again, prompting some governments to consider re-imposing unpopular lockdowns.

Roughly six per cent of Austria's population is fully vaccinated against COVID-19, which is one of the lowest rates in western Europe. 

Those aged 12 and under will be exempt from the lockdown, under which the unvaccinated can only leave their homes for a limited number of reasons like going to work or shopping for essentials.

Many officials, including within Schallenberg's conservative party and the police, have expressed doubts such a lockdown can be properly enforced since it applies to only part of the population. Schallenberg and Interior Minister Karl Nehammer said, however, that there will be thorough checks by the police.

Ahead of signing the US$1.2-trillion infrastructure bill into law, Biden explained what this bill means for Americans. He said that having this bill signed into law will lead to more jobs across the nation, better internet access, no more lead pipes, among other things.

Later in the day, Biden and China’s Xi Jinping will hold their first presidential meeting. The troubled U.S.-China relationship is demonstrating that the power of one of Biden’s greatest professed strengths as a politician — the ability to connect — has its limits.

""They are taking those rights and they will never give them back unless we make them,"" the leader of the organization Children's Health Defence and nephew of former U.S. president John F. Kennedy told some 7,000 protesters gathered in Milan.

Waving Italian flags and chanting slogans like ""hands off the children,"" the demonstrators expressed their opposition to the Green Pass, a mandatory certificate for all workers in the country.

""It's clearly an instrument for controlling the money supply, controlling individual movements, controlling our kind of new digitalized economy,"" Kennedy told Reuters.

The measure was approved by the Italian government in September, making it obligatory from Oct. 15 for all workers to show proof of either vaccination, a negative test or recent recovery from infection.

About 65 per cent of the population of the European Economic Area (EEA) — which includes the European Union, Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway — have received two doses, according to EU data, but the pace has slowed in recent months. 

Italy will also offer the third dose to people over 40 beginning Dec. 1.
Most Italians support the mandatory Green Pass, opinion polls show, but protests continued.

The asteroid, known as 4660 Nereus, is calculated to be passing about 2.4 million miles away from Earth, however The Scotsman explains that because its diameter is wider than 140 meters and it will approach Earth at less than half the distance from the Earth to the sun, it is classified as “potentially hazardous,” which means only a relatively slight deviation in its massive orbit could place it on a collision course with Earth and that that could cause “major regional damage.”

An unlikely chance of a collision, however, is actually more likely in 2060, when 4660 Nereus will pass within just 745,000 miles of Earth on Valentine’s Day.

Tha5co87nsM,hd,"The sun’s ‘coronal mass ejections’ will increase significantly over the next four years as it ramps up into the next solar cycle maximum in 2025, according to scientists at the Space Weather Prediction Center who spoke to Space.com. and one type in particular could have knock-on consequences for our internet connectivity.

Coronal mass ejections are billion-ton clouds of plasma gas with magnetic fields that are ejected by the sun towards the Earth, where they then create geomagnetic storms.

However, as their frequency increases, larger CMEs can form when later CMEs ‘catch up’ with those that have been ejected before them and the two merge.

One problem with this is that we can only learn a CME's magnetic field when it reaches the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Deep Space Climate Observatory, so its likely effects are not clear until 20 to 30 minutes before it hits Earth and, at that point, in a worst-case scenario, a cannibal solar storm could push the world into an ‘internet apocalypse’ by knocking out satellites,or undersea cables, according to a new research paper from the University of California, Irvine.

At the same time, oil and gas pipelines, networking cables and power grids would also be vulnerable to being knocked out.

RnK3VU67f2Q,hd,"BRUNSWICK, GEORGIA — The owner of the home Gregory McMichael, his son Travis McMichael and William ‘Roddie’ Bryan Jr. accused Ahmaud Arbery of burgling before he was killed has told a jury in the murder trial that he had not asked the men to protect the property and he had called the police to report various people entering the property in the months before Arbery was killed.

The three men, all white, are accused of chasing Arbery, a black man, in vehicles before killing him on February 23, 2020, according to CNN, with Arbery's mother telling CNN's Anderson Cooper Thursday night that her son was “jogging: and “in the midst of his jog” he stopped by an ‘unoccupied home under construction and looked around’ and was “killed immediately.”

The three men involved in the killing have pleaded not guilty to charges of malice and felony murder, plus charges of aggravated assault, false imprisonment and criminal attempt to commit false imprisonment.

The defence argues that Travis McMichael shot Arbery in self-defense as Arbery and Travis McMichael wrestled over Travis' shotgun, though Reuters reports that while Gregory McMichael bloodied himself as he searched Arbery's body for a weapon, he found none, according to police testimony at the trial.

RBCcy6x4DFY,hd,"KENOSHA, WISCONSIN — New drone footage and a medical examiner's explanation may have enhanced the case against Kyle Rittenhouse in his homicide trial, according to USA Today.

Drone footage suggested that although Joseph Rosenbaum had chased Rittenhouse, he was not as close to him during the chase as previous footage indicated, and the medical examiner suggested Rittenhouse shot Rosenbaum twice before firing a lethal shot into his back as he reached a horizontal position.

CNN reports Rittenhouse also shot at three people who confronted him in the aftermath of that shooting on the night of August 25, 2020, during chaotic protests following the police shooting of Jacob Blake.

He fired two shots at one unidentified person and killed Anthony Huber with another shot after Huber had hit him with a skateboard, and finally he shot off most of Gaige Grosskreutz’s right bicep after Grosskreutz had briefly raised his hands to surrender, before moving toward Rittenhouse with his own gun pointed at him.

The prosecution rested on Tuesday, November 9, and the defense opened its case, arguing that Rittenhouse, now 18, fired only in self-defense.

These are some of the reasons why battery manufacturers like Samsung and Panasonic and car makers like Tesla and VW, along with a number of startups are working to eliminate cobalt from lithium-ion batteries completely.

FE4DoCehK9c,hd,"After extending the COP26 climate negotiations an extra day, nearly 200 countries in Glasgow, adopted on Saturday an outcome document that, according to the UN Secretary-General, reflects the interests, the contradictions, and the state of political will in the world today.

In a video message on the conclusion of the Conference, Secretary-General António Guterres said, “unfortunately the collective political will was not enough to overcome some deep contradictions. As I said at the opening, we must accelerate action to keep the 1.5 degree goal alive. Our fragile planet is hanging by a thread. We are still knocking on the door of climate catastrophe.”

He reiterated, “it is time to go into emergency mode — or our chance of reaching net zero will itself be zero.""
Guterres reaffirmed his conviction to “end fossil fuels subsidies. Phase out coal. Put a price on carbon. Build resilience of vulnerable communities against the here and now impacts of climate change. And make good on the $100 billion climate finance commitment to support developing countries.”

He continued, “we did not achieve these goals at this conference. But we have some building blocks for progress. Commitments to end deforestation. To drastically reduce methane emissions. To mobilize private finance around net zero. And the texts today reaffirm resolve towards the 1.5 degree goal. Boost climate finance for adaptation. Recognize the need to strengthen support for vulnerable countries suffering from irreparable climate damage.”
“And for the first time, they encourage International Financial Institutions to consider climate vulnerabilities in concessional financial and other forms of support, including Special Drawing Rights. And finally close the Paris rule book with agreement on carbon markets and transparency,” said Guterres.

The UN chief continued, “these are welcome steps, but they are not enough. Science tells us that the absolute priority must be rapid, deep and sustained emissions reductions in this decade. Specifically — a 45 per cent cut by 2030 compared to 2010 levels. But the present set of Nationally Determined Contributions -- even if fully implemented -will still increase emissions this decade on a pathway that will clearly lead us to well above 2 (two) degrees by the end of the century compared to pre-industrial levels.”
Guterres also welcomed the agreement between US and China here in Glasgow that pledges to accelerate action to reduce emissions in the 2020s.

He added, “to help lower emissions in many other emerging economies, we need to build coalitions of support including developed countries, financial institutions, those with the technical know-how. This is crucial to help each of those emerging countries speed the transition from coal and accelerate the greening of their economies. The partnership with South Africa announced a few days ago is a model for doing just that.”

Guterres also made a particular appeal for the future work in relation to adaptation and the issue of loss and damage. He said, “adaptation isn’t a technocratic issue, it is life or death. I was once Prime Minister of my country. And I imagine myself today in the shoes of a leader from a vulnerable country.”

He continued, “COVID-19 vaccines are scarce. My economy is sinking. Debt is mounting. International resources for recovery are completely insufficient. Meanwhile, although we contributed least to the climate crisis, we suffer most. And when yet another hurricane devastates my country, the treasury is empty.”
The UN chief reiterated that protecting countries from climate disaster is “not charity.”

He said, “it is solidarity and enlightened self-interest. We have another climate crisis today. A climate of mistrust is enveloping our globe. Climate action can help rebuild trust and restore credibility. That means finally delivering on the $100 billion climate finance commitment to developing countries. No more IOUs.”

The UN chief will convene a global stock-taking summit at the heads of state level in 2023. And it means, Guterres said, “beyond the mechanisms already set out in the Paris Agreement – establishing clear standards to measure and analyze net zero commitments from non-state actors. He added that a High-Level Expert Group with that objective will be created.

Guterres closed his statement with a message of hope and resolve to young people, indigenous communities, women leaders, all those leading the climate action army.

He said, “I know many of you are disappointed. Success or failure is not an act of nature. It’s in our hands. The path of progress is not always a straight line. Sometimes there are detours. Sometimes there are ditches.”

He reiterated, “Never give up. Never retreat. Keep pushing forward. I will be with you all the way. COP 27 starts now.”

ri9xt0pLkvc,sd,"UN Under-Secretary-General for Peace Operations Jean-Pierre Lacroix said the G5-Sahel Joint Force is at “a crossroads and there is a risk that it will lose the gains that have been made,” and stressed that it is the “collective responsibility of the international community to support the commendable efforts” made by the countries of the region.

Addressing the Security Council today (12 Nov), Lacroix said since the last meeting of the Council on the Sahel, “the situation in the region has remained very volatile.” He said, “Insecurity and instability severely hamper opportunities for growth and development and civilians pay the highest price. Many lives are lost every day as a result of terrorist acts. Millions of people are displaced, children can no longer go to school and primary health care remains inaccessible to many, even as the pandemic still rages on.”

The UN peacekeeping chief stressed that the fight against terrorism is “one of the greatest challenges of our time and how the the international community responds to it and tackles its root causes will be a litmus test for us.” He added, “In an increasingly complex and interconnected world, many fear being left behind as old systems and orders crumble. We are only at beginning to understand these dynamics and what might prevent the rise and the expansion of terrorist movements. In this context, the important decision of the G5-Sahel member states to take charge of their security challenges, by creating the Joint Force for Combating Terrorism in the Sahel, constitute an important accomplishment.”

Lacroix said the Secretary-General was clear in both a letter to the Council and in his recent report that the Joint Force “remains a vital part of a collective security response to the multiple challenges facing the region: terrorism, weak border security, trafficking in persons, illicit goods, weapons and drugs.” He said it is the collective responsibility of the international community to support “the commendable efforts of the G5-Sahel member states.”

The Under-Secretary-General said the UN peacekeeping mission in Mali (MINUSMA) has spared no effort in supporting the Joint Force, within the framework of its mandate and has undertaken all necessary steps to ensure that contractors can deliver life support consumables to all seven battalions deployed under Joint Force command. However, He stressed that this support model is limited, namely because it relies on donor financing, which is by definition unpredictable.
Lacroix said the UN remained convinced that only a dedicated support office, funded through assessed contribution, can provide the Joint Force with the support it needs. He said the UN’s second option would be to set up an advisory office which could also assist with efforts to strengthen institutional governance within the G5.

The peacekeeping chief said important strides have been made by G5-Sahel states in the prevention and mitigation of human rights violations by elements of their armed and security forces while carrying out counter-terrorism operations, but much still needs to be done. He said the establishment of a dedicated support office would provide an opportunity to scale up not only logistical and operational support, but also efforts to protect civilians, promote human rights, and ensure greater coherence between military and political and development efforts.

He said, “Security efforts alone are not sufficient to address the crisis in the Sahel. A holistic approach is required. One that honors the primacy of politics, addresses governance deficits and the root causes of poverty and exclusion and which seeks to provide opportunities and fulfilled lives for the many young people in the region.”

Lacroix reiterated the call of the Secretary-General for the establishment of a dedicated political forum, comprising representatives of the G5 and other international and regional organizations, such as the African Union, ECOWAS, the United Nations and the European Union, as well as members of the Security Council. This forum, he said, would both promote regional ownership and foster enhanced international support while ensuring that the operations of the Force are aligned with important political processes, including the implementation of the Agreement on Peace and Reconciliation in Mali.",PT8M15S,none,2021-11-13T14:00:32Z,"UN, United Nations, sahel, Africa, DPKO, Peacekeeping, Peace and Security",G5-Sahel Joint Force at a crossroads & at risk of losing the gains made - Security Council Briefing

Carrilho said women’s participation during Police Week, “brought important perspectives to all areas of our work, not least more impactful, gender responsive policing.”

Speaking to reporters from Abyei, Police Commissioner Violet Lusala of United Nations Interim Security

This year, within the context of Action for Peacekeeping (A4P) and A4P+ priorities, sessions focused on enhancing partnerships and fostering greater integration and coherence in United Nations policing; strengthening UNPOL’s impact in the protection of civilians and prevention of transnational threats; improving performance, capabilities, and mindsets; reinforcing good practices and lessons learned to mitigate the impact of COVID-19; and ensuring gender- and environmentally responsive policing within field missions.",PT36M38S,none,2021-11-14T14:00:03Z,"UN, United Nations",Conclusion of UN Police Week - Press Conference (12 November 2021) | United Nations | UNPOL

COP26  
At the Climate Change Conference in Glasgow, the Secretary-General today met with various negotiating groups, including the High Ambition Coalition, the Least Developed Countries group, the ministers of the G77 + China and the Alliance of Small Island Developing States. He is still pushing for higher ambition on all fronts, including on the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, adaptation, mitigation and financing for developing countries. 
 
LIBYA 
The Secretary-General spoke by video message to the Paris conference on Libya that is underway right now, and he said that today’s conference has one overriding goal: to seize this moment for peace. Peace that the Libyan people have been denied for far too long.  
He noted that the majority of Libyans support holding elections scheduled for the 24th of December. Nearly three million people have registered to vote so far. Their aspirations and determination to participate in free and fair elections must be met, he said. 
The Secretary-General strongly urged Libyans to come together in a spirit of national unity, to overcome remaining differences, and forge a consensus on the legal framework for the elections, in consultation with all relevant national institutions, adhering to their rules and procedures. And he called on all Libyan parties to participate in the election process, and to respect the election results.  
The Secretary-General also urged all those with power and influence over the situation to put the nation’s wellbeing and prosperity ahead of their own personal interests. Any party that deliberately undermines or sabotages peace must be held accountable, he said. 

SECURITY COUNCIL 
This morning at the Security Council, Jean-Pierre Lacroix, the head of the Department of Peace Operations, briefed on the G5 Sahel Joint Force. He said the situation in the region has remained volatile and civilians continue to pay the highest price.  
The security forces of the G5-Sahel member states face this threat with determination and courage, Mr. Lacroix said. Nevertheless, the G5 Sahel Force also continues to face important challenges.  
We remain convinced, Mr. Lacroix told Council Members, that only a dedicated support office, funded through assessed contribution, can provide the Joint Force with the support it needs. 
He also reiterated the Secretary-General’s call for the establishment of a dedicated political forum to promote regional ownership and foster enhanced international support while ensuring that the operations of the Force are aligned with important political processes, including the implementation of the Agreement on Peace and Reconciliation in Mali. 

And, before this meeting, the Security council also voted to extend the mandate of the UN Mission in the Central African Republic for one year.  

YEMEN 
The Deputy Spokesman said the UN is aware of reports of the withdrawal of Government of Yemen forces from around areas south of Hudaydah city up to Al Tuhayta district, and indications that Houthi forces have now moved into much of the vacated areas.   
The UN was not informed in advance of the movements. Nevertheless, the United Nations Mission to support the Hudaydah Agreement (UNMHA) is monitoring the situation closely and liaising with the parties to establish the facts on the ground and to respond, as necessary, according to its mandate.   
The UN calls on all parties to the conflict to ensure the safety and security of civilians in and around those areas where shifts in frontlines have taken place.

SECURITY COUNCIL 
This morning, the Security Council discussed Syria in its closed consultations.  Geir Pedersen, the Special Envoy for Syria, and Martin Griffiths, the head of humanitarian affairs, briefed the Council on the latest developments there. 
This afternoon, the Council will meet on Sudan and South Sudan, followed by a meeting on Somalia. 

ETHIOPIA 
The Emergency Relief Coordinator, Martin Griffiths, today allocated $25 million from the Central Emergency Response Fund, or CERF, to support humanitarian assistance and the protection of civilians in Ethiopia.  
A $15 million allocation from the Ethiopia Humanitarian Fund was also announced. 
These funds will help scale up emergency operations in Ethiopia’s conflict-affected northern regions and support early response to the drought in southern Ethiopia.  
In the regions of Tigray, Amhara and Afar, the funds will help aid agencies provide protection and other assistance to people affected by the conflict.  
In the drought-affected Somali and Oromia regions, agencies will provide drinking water to prevent waterborne diseases and help pastoral communities to maintain their livestock. 
Today’s allocation brings CERF’s support to Ethiopia this year to $65 million, making Ethiopia the second-highest recipient of CERF funds in 2021. Support from the Ethiopia Humanitarian Fund this year now totals $80 million. 
Humanitarian operations throughout Ethiopia face a funding gap of $1.3 billion, including $350 million for the response in Tigray.

SECRETARY-GENERAL/CLIMATE CHANGE
This morning, the Secretary-General spoke at the Global Climate Action High-Level Event at the COP26 UN Climate Change Conference in in Glasgow.
He said the announcements made in Scotland are encouraging – but they are far from enough.
He underscored that the emissions gap remains a devastating threat and the finance and adaptation gap represent a glaring injustice for the developing world.
He called for more ambitious future revised Nationally Determined Contributions and for implementation of the countries’ pledges. 
He also said that he was inspired by the mobilization of civil society, the moral voice of young people and the dynamism and example of indigenous communities. 
Governments need to pick up the pace and show the necessary ambition on mitigation, adaptation and finance in a balanced way. He said we cannot settle for the lowest common denominator.
He also met with more leaders on the sidelines of COP, including Frans Timmermans, the Vice-President of the European Commission; a group of mayors; and ministers from Russia and China.
 
SECRETARY-GENERAL/PARIS PEACE FORUM
The Secretary-General is also about to speak, via pre-recorded video message, to the Paris Peace Forum.
He will say at a time when fractures are greatly threatening the world, he will encourage leaders to engage in dialogue and conflict prevention. He will also call for greater solidarity as the only way to heal the great fractures of this world.

ETHIOPIA
On the situation in northern Ethiopia: Our humanitarian colleagues say that people in Amhara need shelter, food, and water, as well as medicines and protection, as fighting in Amhara has led to many people being newly displaced from Dessie, Kombolcha, Baati, Kamissie and other areas in Amhara.
Tens of thousands of internally displaced people have reportedly registered in the city of Debre Berhan, with many people taking shelter in two schools there.
Thousands of people are also reportedly displaced from Chifra and Ada’ar in Afar as well. The majority of these people are women and children, once again.
As you know, the delivery of urgent humanitarian aid has been hampered by lack of access due to insecurity. Electricity and telecommunications have also been cut in Dessie and Kombolcha in Amhara province since October 30th. In Amhara, some 915,000 people have received food assistance and nearly 160,000 people have received shelter and other items since August.
No UN-organized humanitarian supplies have arrived in Tigray through the Semera-Abala-Mekelle route since October 18th. In Semera, 364 trucks are on hold, pending authorization from the authorities to proceed.
The continuing fuel and cash shortage is significantly affecting our partners’ ability to transport supplies, including food. The lack of essential medical equipment, supplies, and vaccines across the whole of Tigray is also seriously impacting the availability of health care.
Humanitarian partners remain in Tigray and aim to deliver assistance with available resources.
Between October 28th and November 3rd, some 112,000 people received food in Tigray, which is well below the average of 870,000 people who should be assisted each week.
Throughout the country, humanitarian operations face a funding gap of $1.3 billion, including $350 million for the response in Tigray alone.

Rr_M-mISr-4,sd,"United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali (MINUSMA) Police Commissioner, Patricia Boughani, said the Beijing Declaration and Programme of Action of 1995 as well as resolutions 1325 and 2122 lay the foundation for integrating women into the heart of peace and security processes.

She said the high profile of women within UNPOL “should encourage the Malian population, but also the Malian security forces to understand the assets and qualities of women, and even to encourage women to take up the careers in posts that are traditionally considered as male dominated ones.”

Boughani stressed that the gender dimension within the Malian security forces can be seen through UNPOL’s joint patrols, colocation, showing the skills and competencies of women through its training within which it systematically requests women be present, and raising awareness on gender issues.

The Police Commissioner underscored the need to be creative to further develop synergy of action with other substantive sections in MINUSMA in order to promote the gender perspective. She said, taking into consideration cultural trends and given the fact that few women are deployed in the Malian security forces in the Center and North regions, UNPOL is developing several strategies, including capacity building for the Malian security forces, training courses as part of its global project, financial empowerment of women through quick impact projects, and setting up local police forces.

Boughani said MINUSMA and UNPOL are conducting numerous actions to promote the gender issue, adding that the mission is aware that this is a very large-scale task.",PT8M35S,none,2021-11-11T05:00:17Z,"UN, United Nations, gender equality, minusma, un police, unpol",Actions to Promote the Gender Issue inside UN Police- Security Council Briefing (MINUSMA)
QjdT3-FPEq4,sd,"Violet Lusala, Police Commissioner at the United Nations Interim Security Force for Abyei (UNISFA), said the improved relationship between Sudan and South Sudan has not yet translated into progress towards finding a political solution for the final status of Abyei. She said challenges to the protection of civilians and UNISFA mandate implementation in general remain, including limited rule of law structures, human rights violations, impediments to humanitarian assistance, and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Lusala said UNPOL’s efforts have been hampered by the unwillingness of South Sudan to participate in a joint integrated planning exercise for the establishment of Abyei Police Service; failure of both parties to review and endorse the MoU on the handing over of suspects; reluctance by Sudan to issue visas for UNPOL personnel to enable the Police Component to reach the authorized ceiling of 148 Individual Police Officers and the deployment of three Formed Police Units, all of which have affected the Mission’s efforts to address criminality. She stressed that the continued non-establishment of the Abyei Police Service has created a vacuum for local law enforcement, while the lack of basic services such as water, health and education is also a criminogenic factor.

The Police Commissioner urged the Council to “impress upon the two governments to immediately establish the Abyei Police Service.” Moreover, she said, “the establishment of the Office of the Public Defender in Abyei would facilitate judicial action and alleviate the conditions in detention facilities. The governments of Sudan and South Sudan should also be encouraged to provide basic services across Abyei. Meanwhile, UNPOL remains committed to continue delivering on its mandate and adapting to the realities on the ground.”",PT7M44S,none,2021-11-11T13:00:12Z,"UN, United Nations, UN Interim Security Force for Abyei, unpol, un police, UNISFA",Sudan & South Sudan: Challenges to the protection of civilians - Security Council Briefing (UNISFA)

NAzo3do7llU,hd,"The husband of Iranian detainee Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe has said he is entering ""uncharted territory"" this week, as he reached his 18th day of hunger strike outside the UK’s Foreign Office today.

Richard Ratcliffe began protesting to put pressure on UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson to meet Iranian delegates at the COP26 climate conference to demand freedom for Britons detained in Iran.

The Foreign Office has said: ""We are doing all we can to help Nazanin get home.""

Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe, a British-Iranian dual national, has been in custody in Iran since 2016 after being accused of plotting to overthrow the government.

tJKVuC-NWnU,hd,"Three years ago, Cape Town in South Africa came dangerously close to completely running out of water when a severe and unanticipated drought turned all local reservoirs into dustbowls.

To prevent this happening again, dozens of teams armed with chainsaws are seeking to protect those reservoirs in an unusual manner - by chopping down tens of thousands of trees on the mountains surrounding them.

It seems counter-intuitive - but non-native trees are responsible for using an equivalent of two to three months of Cape Town's annual water consumption.

qPcsTDh_ZEo,hd,"The European Commission has accused Belarus's authoritarian leader of luring migrants with the false promise of easy entry to EU countries as part of an ""inhuman, gangster-style approach"".

At least 2,000 migrants are now at the Belarus border with Poland.

A spokesman said on arrival they were being pushed to the border and forced to make an illegal entry into the European Union.

Poland and Lithuania are both enforcing states of emergencies at their border with Belarus as the thousands of migrants attempt to cross.

Belarus's leader Alexander Lukashenko denies orchestrating the problem.

dQqhCkRE0ik,hd,"Countries are being urged to strengthen their carbon-cutting targets by the end of 2022 in a draft agreement published at the COP26 Glasgow climate summit.

The document says vulnerable nations must get more help to cope with the deadly impacts of global warming.

It also says countries should submit long-term strategies for reaching net-zero by the end of next year.

Critics have said the draft pact does not go far enough but others welcomed its focus on the 1.5C target.

The European Union is threatening to impose new sanctions on Belarus which it says is deliberately sending migrants from the Middle East across its borders into the EU. 

In recent weeks thousands of people have gathered on the border, hoping to cross from Belarus into Poland and the European Union.

The roots of the Taliban movement go back to 1979, when the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan. They were there to prop up a communist Afghan government that was supported by a minority of urban residents. But the vast majority of Afghans lived in rural areas. Here, authority came from tribal and ethnic groups, and life revolved around conservative practices of Islam. 

Rural Afghans formed militias called mujahideen and drove out the Soviets. But then they fell into a civil war with each other. Out of this chaos emerged a group of Islamic teachers and students called the Taliban. They swept through the country, destroying mujahideen groups and imposing a strict order. In 1996, they took the capital city of Kabul. The Taliban ruled Afghanistan until 2001, when the US invaded. 

In a sense, the cycle of invasion and rebellion began again. Urban areas were reformed while rural areas suffered, allowing the Taliban to resurge. In 2021, the Taliban took back Kabul and the country.

The federal government has supplied water to farmers in the Klamath Basin region for more than a century, part of a project to encourage white settlement and agriculture in the western US.

But in 2021, amid extreme heat and drought, the government shut off the water to protect endangered fish that are sacred to Native American tribes there.

D5mU5JYE8FM,hd,"Allegations of racism at England’s Yorkshire County Cricket Club are sparking a wider conversation about how minorities are treated in the sport. 

A recent investigation found that one of the club’s former players, Azeem Rafiq, was routinely subjected to racial abuse and harassment. Rafiq says he often felt like an outsider and that the abuse got so bad he contemplated taking his own life. 
 
The case received widespread condemnation from members of parliament including Julian Knight, chair of the House of Commons' Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) Select Committee.
 
Roger Hutton, the chairman of Yorkshire, resigned over the handling of Rafiq’s case. Two other board members also announced plans to step down as the fallout continues. Sportswear giant Nike announced it would no longer be the kit supplier for the club. 
 
The Yorkshire saga has exposed what many say is an ugly truth. That despite a diverse fan base, English cricket is too white and does not reflect a changed UK. In this episode of The Stream, we ask whether English cricket has a problem with racism.

""Former President Trump hammered former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie (R) on Monday after Christie called on Republicans to move past Trump’s baseless claim that the 2020 election had been stolen from him.

Christie, a former Trump ally, made the remarks at the Republican Jewish Coalition’s conference in Las Vegas, during which he urged the GOP to present a “plan for tomorrow, not a grievance about yesterday.” 

“Winning campaigns are always the campaigns that look forward, not backward,” he said, warning that Republicans would pay a political price if they continue to dwell on the 2020 presidential election.""

Prager was on Newsmax Monday telling Chris Salcedo President Joe Biden “ruined” the economy with his policies.

“If we survive this as a free country, historians will just ask how did this happen? How did people get governed by irrational fears?”

One of those “irrational” fears he cited was the millions of unvaccinated Americans.""

""Republican Rep. Fred Upton on Monday shared a threatening voicemail he had received after voting for the bipartisan infrastructure bill last week.

In the voicemail, which Upton played during an interview with CNN's Anderson Cooper on 
""AC360,"" a caller told the Michigan Republican: ""I hope you die. I hope everybody in your f**king family dies,"" while labeling him a ""f**king piece of sh*t traitor.""

Upton was one of just 13 House Republicans who voted with Democrats on Friday to pass the $1.2 trillion infrastructure bill after hours of delays and debate among Democrats. The legislation, which passed the Senate in August, will deliver $550 billion in new federal investments in America's infrastructure over five years, including roads, bridges, mass transit, rail, airports, ports, and waterways.""

qBYLa8UcezA,sd,"(5 Nov 2021) Thousands of ultra-Orthodox Jews gathered at the Western Wall in Jerusalem on Friday to protest against a Jewish women’s group that holds monthly prayers there in a long-running campaign for gender equality at the site.
For decades the ""Women of the Wall"" group has campaigned for equality of worship at the Western Wall, one of Judaism's holiest sites. 
Israel's religious institutions are dominated by the ultra-Orthodox, who are opposed to any changes at the site, where men and women pray in separate areas. 
The dispute has sharpened since the swearing-in of a new government in June pushed Israel's ultra-Orthodox parties into the opposition. 
A newly elected lawmaker, who is also a Reform rabbi, used his parliamentary immunity to bring Torah scrolls into the women's section in defiance of rules enforced by the ultra-Orthodox administrators of the site.
Police set up metal barricades and deployed in large numbers to hold back the mostly male protesters, who blew whistles and occasionally surged forward only to be pushed back. 
The women carried empty mantles used to cloak Torah scrolls to protest the prohibition on bringing the scrolls themselves into the women's section.
Anat Hoffman, the founder of the group, said they were ""fighting for equality and religious pluralism and justice.""
""We cannot read from the Torah in the women's section in 2021,"" she said, adding, ""Why not? Why the hell not?""
The protests were called for by ultra-Orthodox leaders, including Aryeh Deri, head of the Shas party. 
In a tweet on Friday that was shared by former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Deri called on his supporters to come out ""so that, heaven forbid, this holy place is not desecrated.""
Gilad Kariv, a Reform rabbi and newly elected parliament member from the center-left Labor party, had planned to bring a Torah scroll into the site for the women to use, but called off his visit at the request of Israeli President Isaac Herzog, who sought to prevent conflict at the site.
Netanyahu had shelved plans for an egalitarian prayer space at the wall in 2017 under pressure from the ultra-Orthodox parties who are politically allied with him.
The move infuriated adherents of more liberal strains of Judaism to which most Jews in North America adhere. 
The dispute has been a major point of friction between the two largest Jewish communities in the world, in Israel and the United States.

ARjNDuECmFY,sd,"(5 Nov 2021) Standing close to one another on a sunny autumn day, a group of people waited patiently by a blue bus parked beneath a bridge in Belgrade.
For them, this will be a rare chance to have a shower, wash their clothes or get a medical checkup. 
Three times a week, a humanitarian organization working in Serbia opens the doors of their mobile bus center for the homeless, offering basic services and help to some of the thousands of people living and sleeping rough in the Balkan country's capital city. 
The project of the Adventist Development and Relief Agency has developed gradually over the past four years, but it has grown in importance since the start of the coronavirus pandemic that has pushed already vulnerable communities further to the margins.
Routinely suffering from chronic diseases, mental health problems or substance abuse, homeless people in Belgrade in most cases have no documents and live outside the state radar. 
The ADRA group aims to offer immediate help and try to get homeless people back into the system in the long run, said Igor Mitrovic, the executive manager of the ADRA group that is behind the project.
""They have been - almost all of them - excluded or abandoned by society,"" he said. ""They ended up without IDs, without any link with the system of health care or social welfare.""
While the sight of homeless people sleeping in parks and streets is common in most world capitals, in Serbia they emerged relatively recently, after the 1990s' violent breakup of the former Communist-run Yugoslavia and the post-war transition.
Mitrovic said Belgrade's homeless are therefore mostly people in their 50s' and older, who found themselves lost in the chaos of the economic destruction that followed the Yugoslav wars and the collapse of the state. 
A city of 2 million people, Belgrade has a city-run shelter, but its capacity of some 100 places normally is fully booked well in advance.
Authorities have promised to open an additional shelter and have set up temporary facilities in various parts of the city. 
Part of the international ADRA network, the Serbian branch has worked on the bus project in partnership with the Belgrade city authorities and US and Slovak governments through USAID and SlovakAid agencies, Mitrovic said. 
The bus dubbed ""Drumodom,"" which roughly translates to ""Road home,"" is envisaged as a temporary stop on the ""way back home"" for the homeless people.
Already without income, marginal groups such as the homeless have found their options even more limited during the COVID-19 pandemic that increased existing social gaps, Mitrovic explained. 
This has added to the isolation of the vulnerable communities, particularly during near-total lockdown period last year.

P7f01owImgU,sd,"(5 Nov 2021) A plane loaded with nearly 10 tons of food arrived in Cuba on Friday, as non-government organizations looked to support the population and demonstrate their disagreement with sanctions imposed by the US.
The consignment contained tuna cans and pasta, but donors indicated that it will later be complemented by powdered milk and cooking oil. 
Those basic products are often in short supply on the island.
Medea Benjamin of the Code Pink NGO, one of the donors, said she was ""disgusted"" at US sanctions.
Benjamin said the shipment was possible due to a small group of people fighting the policies of the US. 
""It is not a policy that represents the people of the United States,"" she added.
The aid was received by the Martin Luther King Center in Havana, an evangelical religious institution and will be taken to the eastern provinces.
Reverend Raúl Suárez, director of the MLK Center,  said the current US administration has not changed anything from the ""aggressive, unloving, un-Christian policies.""

TtX7011OuZo,sd,"(5 Nov 2021) China on Friday criticized a press freedom survey from the Hong Kong Foreign Correspondents’ Club that found nearly half its members were considering leaving the city. 
The survey said the members were concerned about a decline in press freedoms under a sweeping national security law imposed by Beijing following massive anti-government protests in 2019. 
Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said at a regular news briefing that the rights of foreign media and journalists in Hong Kong would be ""fully protected"" as long as they report in accordance with the law.
Wang said that as of April this year, there were 628 foreign employees with work visas for foreign media in Hong Kong, a 18.5% increase from the same time last year.
The survey comes as authorities are cracking down on political dissent in Hong Kong. Most of the city's prominent pro-democracy activists are currently in jail. 
Separately, Wang insisted that foreign media would be guaranteed freedom of reporting at the 2022 Winter Olympic Games in Beijing.
His comments followed a call from the US State Department for foreign media to be allowed freedom of movement and access during the event.
""All registered foreign media reporters are allowed to cover the Beijing Winter Olympic and Paralympic Games and related events in China in compliance with relevant Chinese laws, regulations and pandemic control policies,"" said Wang.
He said China was opposed to the ""politicisation"" of sport and urged the US to ""stop making irresponsible remarks.""
Wang also defended China's judicial procedures over the case of Zhang Zhan, a Chinese citizen journalist who is serving a four-year sentence after reporting on the early stage of the COVID-19 pandemic in the city of Wuhan.
Zhang's brother posted on Twitter over the weekend that she is close to death.

cmenZtqBusE,sd,"(5 Nov 2021) Tourists in Mexico expressed concern Friday, a day after gunmen stormed ashore at a beach on the Caribbean coast in front of luxury hotels and executed two drug dealers from a rival gang . 
The attack sent tourists scrambling for cover at the resort of Puerto Morelos, just south of Cancun. 
The two suspected drug dealers who were killed had apparently arrived at the beach in front of the Azul Beach Resort and the Hyatt Ziva Riviera Cancun earlier in the day, claiming it was now their territory. 
""I mean, we know the drug cartels are not interested in us, they are not interested in the tourists, because we were only 20 feet away from them and they didn't even look at us"", said Cliff Jackson, a tourist from England sunbathing on the shore Friday. 
The shooting were the latest chapter in drug gang violence that has sullied the reputation of Mexico's Caribbean coast as a once-traquil oasis.
""At the back of my mind, I was always worried about coming because of this situation. And so, to be here while that's happened, it's frightening to be honest,"" said Maria Hutchins, a tourist from England. 
Cartel members often kill rival dealers in Mexico to eliminate competition and ensure their drugs are sold first.  
The Puerto Morelos shooting comes two weeks after a California travel blogger and a German tourist were killed in a similar shootout in the beach town of Tulum.

_GU_oUWGkaI,sd,"(5 Nov 2021) LEAD IN:
In Lebanon's Beqaa Valley, the organic farm of Buzuruna Juzuruna encourages people to plant and save heirloom seeds to mitigate the country's food insecurity.

STORY-LINE:
As Lebanon progressively becomes more food insecure, farmers and activists say turning towards sustainable agriculture using local seeds can improve people's access to healthy meals.
Lebanon relies heavily on food imports to feed its population.
The county is currently undergoing a huge economic crisis, and over the past two years its currency has lost more than 90% of its purchasing power, while food prices have increased by over 600%.
According to the World Food Programme (WFP), 22% of the Lebanese and 83% of refugees living in Lebanon are now food insecure.  
Commercial agriculture relies on costly inputs like buying seeds and pesticides, each of which are imported. 
But with the use of heirloom seeds that can be saved year after another, unlike commercial ones that are sterile, and engaging with organic agriculture, these input costs are eliminated. 
Leading the way in organic farming and seed saving is Buzuruna Juzuruna, Arabic for ""our seeds, our roots"", a community-focused farm in Lebanon's Beqaa Valley.
The farm's co-founder, Walid El Youssef, says seeds and planting food needs to be independent from the economic situation in the country.
He says Buzuruna Juzuruna is working to bring back heirloom seeds ""that are becoming lost and extinct to reproduce and multiply them in an organic way, while respecting the ecosystem, the earth and people"".
The farm has been running for five years, and now has over 150 heirloom vegetable seeds and 80 to 60 kinds of wheat seeds -- collected and saved from ancient varieties in Lebanon. 
This means that they don't have to pay money to import seeds from large international companies that control the market. 
Without using pesticides and chemicals, Buzuruna Juzuruna plant diversely rather than monocropping to attract pollinators and natural enemies of crop pests.
They also make their own natural pest control mixes, primarily from plant ingredients such as chili and garlic mixed with natural, locally made soap. 
El Youssef says he hopes that people will start thinking beyond food security and look towards creating what he calls food sovereignty. 
""Seeds are people's property; they don't belong to companies or individuals... Everyone should have access to seeds,"" he adds.

RESTRICTION SUMMARY: 
ASSOCIATED PRESS
Chelem - 6-8 October 2021 
ASSOCIATED PRESS
Dzilam de Bravo - 7, 8 October 2021 
STORYLINE: 
Cuando huele a huevo podrido en las ciénagas del sureste mexicano es que algo va bien. Significa que se ha recuperado el manglar, un hábitat costero clave para mitigar el impacto de los huracanes y que captura y almacena como nada dióxido de carbono, el principal causante del calentamiento global.
Mientras el mundo busca cómo frenar la crisis climática en la conferencia de las Naciones Unidas en Escocia, uno de los frentes de batalla para salvar el manglar está a miles de kilómetros de allí, en la península de Yucatán, donde los discursos son sustituidos por horas de trabajo pala en mano, lodo hasta la cintura y un sol abrasador sobre la cabeza.
Hace décadas los manglares perfilaban ampliamente muchas de las costas de México. Ahora sólo quedan estrechas franjas verdes junto al mar que se recortan entre zonas ya muertas de color rojizo por el exceso de sal y otras marrones y anegadas en las que despuntan algunas ramas secas.
Sin embargo, un puñado de mujeres y de pescadores de Yucatán, con el apoyo de académicos y activistas y dinero procedente de donaciones y subvenciones, han hecho del cuidado de los manglares parte de su vida pese a la indiferencia de muchos de sus vecinos, el imparable crecimiento urbanístico y la falta de recursos para la conservación. 
Comenzaron hace más de una década de la mano de Jorge Alfredo Herrera, del Centro de Investigación y de Estudios Avanzados del Instituto Politécnico de México en Yucatán, sin apenas saber nada del manglar, salvo que era hogar de ostiones y camarones. Nunca pensaron que se convertirían en expertos. 
Herrera les explicó que primero había que cavar canales interconectados para que el agua dulce y la salada volvieran a fluir, pues es la base de la vida de este árbol que durante siglos supo adaptarse a un entorno híbrido entre la tierra y el mar. 
El trabajo era duro, mal pagado -cuatro dólares al día- y apenas garantizado para unas cuantas jornadas. Los hombres de Chelem, un pueblo de pescadores de Progreso -en el norte de la península- lo rechazaron. Entonces las mujeres dieron un paso al frente. ""Con eso (dinero) nosotras hacíamos maravillas"", bromeó Keila Vázquez.  
Este año, después de una intensa temporada de lluvias, el grupo de mujeres que lidera Vázquez se afanaba por acabar con la segunda parte del proceso de restauración de la ciénaga cercana a Progreso: la siembra de mangle. Bajo el sol y entre risas recordaban el día en que se toparon con un cocodrilo y apenas podían correr en medio de esa especie de arena movediza.
En una barca de madera empujada entre varias, llevaban costales que previamente habían llenado de fango y brotes de unos 50 centímetros. Luego los colocaban cuidadosamente en montículos de lodo rodeados de malla para evitar que se desmoronen. Son como islotes de un metro cuadrado cuyo crecimiento vigilan atentamente. Al fondo, descansaban  unos flamencos.
""El día más feliz es cuando pegan nuestras plantas"", dijo sonriente Vázquez, de 41 años, orgullosa de poner su granito de arena para el bienestar del planeta. ""Son como nuestros hijos"".
AMENAZA GLOBAL
Este esfuerzo de restauración del manglar es similar al que se realiza en otros lugares del mundo como Indonesia, el país que más extensión tiene, o Colombia, y se ha ido afianzando a medida que se hizo evidente la urgente necesidad de proteger estos peculiares bosques que amortiguan huracanes y marejadas, son cortina de protección para muchas especies y, sobre todo, son un impresionante almacén de carbono.

While world leaders seek ways to stop the climate crisis at a United Nations conference in Scotland this month, one front in the battle to save the planet's mangroves is thousands of miles (kilometers) away on Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula.
Decades ago, mangroves lined these shores, but today there are only thin green bands of trees beside the sea, interrupted by urbanized areas and reddish segments killed by too much salt and by dead branches poking from the water. 
Mangroves are a vital element of tropical ecosystems. 
But they are critically endangered by the human impact.  
A group of women in Southern Mexico have found a way to restore them by planting mangrove saplings.  
""We are planting more red mangrove so that more species will come here. We are happy that people can enjoy the result of what we do, that's why I am happy,' said mangrove restorer Martina Cohuo.
Funded by the local government, the conservation effort helps the team earn an extra money whilst contributing to the development of their community. 
In the small coastal villages of Yucatan, mangroves serve as barriers against hurricanes and secure a source of income for fishing communities. 
Conservationist Jorge Herrera understood early the importance of mangroves and has since fought hard to preserve them. 
""Mangroves are the first curtain of protection from the events that come from the ocean to the land and it reflects the retaining of pollutants coming from the land. Mangroves are a filter, a curtain for the air, but on the other hand they are really productive, which means they host a lot of life,"" Herrera said.
More so, mangroves have kept a secret for millennia. Unlike other plants, they are able to store the carbon they capture.  
By area, mangroves absorb at least five times as much carbon as tropical rainforests.  
They are precious allies against climate change.  
""The soil is flooded and doesn't allow the organic matter to oxidize and decompose and go into the atmosphere. This causes the mangrove to be one of the ecosystems that accumulates more carbon in the soil and that absorbs the carbon really quickly,"" Herrera said.
But reforestation is not enough.  
Mangroves have to be constantly maintained by the creation of water canals that facilitate the flow of salty water within freshwater, in which they thrive. 
Canals also carry the seeds that will slowly restore affected areas through hydrological restoration.  
Fisherman Manuel González is a community leader and a fisherman who is deeply passionate about restoring the mangrove he grew up in.  
""The danger of the mangroves here, after the hurricanes it's us - the human beings. People don't think that to cut a mangrove means cutting a life,"" González said.
Road and commercial developments in the area are putting a strain on mangroves, causing a massive release of carbon every time they are cut off.  
For those who are on the forefront in the fight against climate change, there is little time left.  
For inaction means putting their very lives at stake.

BnZsO-Mssxc,hd,"An Alberta doctor may need to think about buying a superhero costume after saving two men in the past 18 months through CPR, then operating on them days later.

In June of 2020, Dr. Corey Adams and his wife Jennifer, who is also a doctor, were hiking near Canmore, Alberta when someone called for help. A man had turned blue after collapsing and quick work administering CPR by Adams helped the man. Days later, he performed a quintuple heart bypass on the same man.

It happened again in August of this year when, while on an outing with their children, the couple spotted a man who collapsed while running. Adams again performed CPR. The man was born with a heart defect and days later, Adams was the one to perform a valve replacement.

“If you look at life being like a small world, and it happens one time … but the second time? What the heck is just happening here?”’ He said.

As Jill Croteau reports, it's two chance encounters that led to two men receiving the help they needed from a couple who were just out for a walk.

nd6u0KmlnUE,hd,"Political and security risk analyst Alex Kokcharov said during an interview with Global News on Wednesday that Belarus has “facilitated” the migrant crisis at its border with Poland, adding that the migrants flew into Belarus after obtaining visas.

“It means that Belarus is completely aware of what’s going on,” he said. 

Kokcharov says that poor conditions at the border will result in an increased number of “security incidents” as migrants use “whatever method they have” to cross the border. 

He says he believes Belarus is hoping the European Union will offer it a package to deal with the migrant crisis as it did for Turkey in 2015, but that doing so would signal “tacit” approval for the Lukashenko government in the wake of the disputed 2020 election.

But instead, they are trapped in freezing weather on the Polish border, with no shelter or food. Earlier this year, the European Union followed by Canada, the United Kingdom and the United States, imposed new sanctions on Lukashenko and Belarus for human rights abuses.

As Crystal Goomansingh reports, Lukashenko is being accused of using the migrants as political pawns in retaliation against the European Union.

gh8eRHEPyt4,hd,"Feeling the pressures of a society plagued by climate change, soaring home prices, economic inequality and poverty, many young Canadians say they are feeling less than optimistic about the direction of our nation and cite the baby boom generation as one of the root causes of disparity and division in society.

A new study done by Angus Reid Institute, in partnership with Cardus, has found a growing divide between younger and older generations. As Erica Vella reports, experts say it’s a similar sentiment to the generation divide of the 1960s.

CBQp-z9brJo,hd,"Hundreds of migrants remain stranded on the Belarusian-Polish border for the third day, with children and babies sleeping in tents amid freezing temperatures.

Coming from the Middle East, Africa and Asia, the migrants were repeatedly denied entry to the European Union by Polish guards, and were faced with violence.

The EU's 27 ambassadors are set to agree on Wednesday that the growing numbers of migrants flying to Belarus to reach the EU border amount to ""hybrid warfare"" by President Alexander Lukashenko - a legal basis for new sanctions.

The EU accuses Belarus of encouraging the migrants to try to illegally cross the frontier as a form of revenge for earlier sanctions imposed on Minsk for prior human rights abuses.

Humanitarian groups accuse Poland's ruling nationalists of violating the international right to asylum by pushing the migrants back into Belarus instead of accepting their applications for protection. Poland says its actions are legal.

The goal for participating countries at the summit is to agree on the rules to keep the average global temperature from rising more than 1.5 Celsius above pre-industrial levels. 

But a new forecast by the Climate Action Tracker, an independent research group, suggests temperatures are on track to rise 2.4 Celsius by the end of the century. Heather Yourex-West looks at why efforts to avert catastrophe are falling short and what more needs to be done.

JoXOEuvcXIQ,hd,"Opening remarks by António Guterres, Secretary-General of the United Nations, on Exclusion, inequality, and conflict - Security Council, 8900th meeting.

"" (...) For the poorest and most vulnerable people, the COVID-19 pandemic has amplified misery and inequalities.

Around 120 million more people have been pushed into poverty.

Hunger and famines are stalking millions of people around the world.

We face the deepest global recession since World War 2.

Billions lack the safety nets they need to cope — social protections, health care and job protection.

People in the richest countries are getting third doses of the COVID-19 vaccine, while only five per cent of Africans are fully vaccinated.

Even before the pandemic, the world’s billionaires held more wealth than 60 per cent of the global population — and that gap has widened enormously.

At the same time, the stage is being set for a lopsided recovery.

While advanced economies are investing 28 per cent of their GDPs into economic recovery, the least-developed countries are investing just 1.8 per cent — of a much smaller amount.  

Mr. President, when speaking about economic inequality last year, you reminded people of the fiction of policies based on the notion that if those at the top are doing well, those at the bottom will, too.

You rightly said: “Wealth isn’t contagious.”

Exclusion and inequalities of all kinds — economic, social and cultural — come with a devastating toll to security.

Indeed, rising inequalities are a factor of rising instability.

Especially in areas where basic services like health, education, security and justice are lacking.

And where historical injustices, inequalities and systematic oppression have locked generations of people in cycles of disadvantage and poverty.

Excellencies,

Today, we face the highest number of violent conflicts since 1945.

They’re lasting longer — and are more complex.

A dangerous sense of impunity is taking hold — seen in the recent seizures of power by force, including military coups.

Human rights and the rule of law are under assault.

From Afghanistan, where girls are once again being denied an education — and women denied their rightful place in society.

To Myanmar, where minorities are targeted, brutalized and forced to flee.

To Ethiopia, where a man-made humanitarian crisis is unfolding before our eyes.

These and other tragedies are enflamed by COVID-19 and the climate emergency.

Humanitarian funding, assistance and conflict management tools — the very kind that the United Nations provides around the world — are all under tremendous strain.
Peace has never been more urgent.

That’s why conflict prevention is at the heart of my proposed New Agenda for Peace, as part of the report on Our Common Agenda.

The Agenda calls on the global community to work as one — in solidarity, as a human family — to address the roots of violent conflicts.

To build and strengthen the bonds of trust between people who inhabit the same borders — and in the governments and institutions representing them.

And for countries in transition, to ensure that all groups are part of the peace process — so people can reject the voices of division and instead lend their hands to the task of shaping a better future for all.

Excellencies,

Without inclusion, the puzzle of peace remains incomplete, with many gaps to be filled.

Today, I’d like to outline a roadmap for inclusion, built around four key pathways to fill these gaps: people, prevention, gender and institutions.

First — we need to invest in the development of all people, equally.
(...)
Second — we need to strengthen our prevention agenda on multiple fronts to address different types of exclusion and inequalities. 
(...)
Third — we must recognize and prioritize the crucial role of women in building peace.
(...)
Fourth — we must build trust through national institutions that include and represent all people, anchored in human rights and the rule of law.
 In every society, diversity of culture, religion and ethnicity should be viewed as a powerful benefit, rather than a threat.
(...)
This is essential in all countries — but especially in those experiencing conflict.

Without full inclusion and equality, peace is a job half done.

Because true, sustainable peace can only be carried forward by people who are supported.

Who are included and valued.

Who feel they are truly part of their society — and have a stake in its future.  

I welcome this Council’s continued support to help every person, everywhere, lend their hands, hearts and minds to the vital task of peace.

Thank you""

SECRETARY-GENERAL/CLIMATE  
The Secretary-General is back in Glasgow for the final days of the UN Climate Change Conference.  
Today he, along with Prime Minister Boris Johnson, met with a group of observers of the UNFCCC process and then with a group of ministers co-facilitating the different tracks of the negotiations.  
He also met with the Prime Minister of Fiji and the First Minister of Scotland. In addition, the Secretary-General met with the US Congressional Delegation led by the Speaker of the House of Representatives of the US, Nancy Pelosi, and he also met with the Environment Minister of South Africa.
This afternoon, he did an Instagram Live with Nicole Becker, a young climate activist from Argentina. Tomorrow he scheduled to speak at the High-Level Event on Global Climate Action.

AFGHANISTAN 
Afghans in need of health care services can now benefit from a new UN Development Programme (UNDP) initiative that has injected acutely needed funding into the deteriorating healthcare system of the country. This allows the system to continue to provide essential health services across the country. The support to Afghanistan’s health system has been delivered under an agreement with the Global Fund, which has provided $15 million to ensure continuity of critical health services. 
As a key part of the emergency initiative aiming to keep the health system functioning, UNDP transferred salaries for the month of October to more than 24,000 workers involved in the health system, including 7,300 women, in nearly 2,200 health facilities. 
The initiative is being implemented in 31 out of 34 provinces across Afghanistan, in cooperation with civil society organizations who are working in the health sector. It aims to reach 26,000 health workers by the time it is fully implemented. 
In addition to the salary disbursements, UNDP has also financed the procurement of essential medicines and health supplies for the participating health facilities.

AFGHANISTAN/HUMANITARIAN UPDATE 
The Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) today said that while violence has reduced in the last quarter across Afghanistan, reports of children killed and injured by unexploded ordnance continue to be reported throughout the country. The UN Mine Action Service and their local and international partners in mine action continue activities to limit the threat posed by mines, explosive remnants of war and improvised explosive devices. 
In September, the UN Mine Action Service established the UN Emergency Mine Action Coordination Centre for Afghanistan. The aim is to ensure that an effective and efficient mine action cooperation mechanism remains in place, in addition to telephone hotlines where people can report threats across the country. More than 4,000 de-miners are continuing to work around Afghanistan since the de facto authorities assumed control on 15 August. 
In positive news related to money, the Flash Appeal for Afghanistan, which seeks $606 million to help people through the end of 2021, is currently 86 per cent funded. Generous contributions and conventions into cash have been made by 19 Member States, as well as the private sector. The breakdown is available on the OCHA website.
